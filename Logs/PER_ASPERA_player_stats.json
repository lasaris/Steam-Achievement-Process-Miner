  "review": "Definitely one of those games you get lost in, look up, and realize the day has gone by.  The story moves along nicely, feels challenging without being punishing, and there are numerous little quality of life things like being able to speed up time and feeling like your choices matter that really make it easy to lose your day in a seamless set of choices and demands, one after the other.  Fantastic game for feeling trapped in a pandemic and scrolling over to find the first hints of water on a dry lifeless planet.  I'm taking the eco-friendly technologies just to see how they affect the planet, and am already looking forward to the destructive speedrun where I nuke everything to hurry it up!",

  "review": "Quite a good game! \nI started playing and finished the game entirely on the 1.2 patch. I read that they have improved the logistics quite a bit. I did not find any issues at all during my playthrough except for a few spelling mistakes. There were plenty of times especially in the first few hours where I was frustrated and felt the game was broken, but it was not. It was always because of mistakes I made - usually because I ignored one or two of the resources going too low and then everything in my base just broke down because of that. I just needed to reload an earlier save and do better. I definitely recommend making new saves every couple of years so you can go back and try different approaches. \nFirst part of the game needs a lot of things to go perfectly, but once you get access to the hyper-loop and figure out how the logistics work, it becomes quite easy to recover from any mistakes.  Just remember that resource mines are not infinite and you will need to constantly expand your base and adapt your production chains accordingly.\n\nBest thing about the game was the voice acting and the UI is just absolutely gorgeous!  I was so engrossed and immersed that I binged through the whole game from the start.  The whole terraforming process along with the storyline was really cool to see progress! However when you reach the final two steps of the campaign, it becomes so very grindy needlessly. So much that I was watching Netflix and doing other things just waiting for the projects to complete for hours and hours, and ended up not really caring about the characters or story anymore. It just totally takes away the immersion and interest. This part can definitely be made better.  \n  \nBut overall, I thought this was an enjoyable 30-40 hour game and well worth the price if you are a base building and sci-fi fan. There are a few different endings to check out as well.",

The wealth of information and decisions that you have to make sometimes becomes overwhelming, but the good news is, if you mess something up, you can fix it later.\n\nOne thing I liked most is how gradual the terraforming project is. It takes months for a colonist ship to arrive, it takes years to melt dry ice at the poles, it took me 16 years from the start of the terraforming project to generate an atmosphere with the pressure 1/3 of Earth's, allowing colonists to live in unpressurised habitats.\n\nIf you like slow and methodical building games, I can recommend this one.",

  "review": "Can hardly call this a balanced game. The worst part is actually the maintanence. Between that and the constant bombardment of meteors. It's pretty much a logistic fucking nightmare. The repair drones are pretty expensive in terms of time to construct and they are literally shit. Also I would like the devs to explain how chemicals and electronics are used to repair buildings. Since that is a massive mystery to me. Not only are they expensive to make but they are also limited uses and will vanish after max 2 uses. And the buildings will decay at a rapid pace. If they fix that. \n\nThis would actually be a pretty good game. But it's just a pain in the ass. So in terms of being realistic they get one point. But I'll remove that point since it's super unrealistic that buildings decay that fast. The resources last for only a few years unless you are lucky and finds one containing 4k. But 90% of them will be between 600-1000. So there they lose yet another point on realism. Mods might same this title. But otherwise, the devs fucked it up big time since they can't understand that they basically made a formula that forces you to rapidly expand because of running out of resources. But expand to much and you won't be able to repair the buildings in time. This makes for a pretty boring and sometimes infuriating gameplay. But what makes it retarded is that you have no power whatsoever to direct the stupid drones to work where they are needed.\n\nIt would have been a much better game if you could make the roads and direct the logistic drones exactly how you want it.

Only a few real choices exist to change the course of the story in any significant way.

  "review": "Per Aspera is a nifty little city-builder/RTS where you play as an AI sent to terraform Mars.  You go through the entire process of starting on a desolate Martian desert landscape to melting the polar icecaps and eventually seeding the planet with water, trees, and animals and stuff.\n\nThere's a lot of thought that went into this game and it shows.  Ocean levels will rise depending on how you play the game which will cut off resources and your buildings if you don't plan accordingly.  The dynamic road generation is real cool to look at as it crawls across the landscape when placing nodes down like lightning or electricity carving through wood.  The story is pretty cool and throws a bunch of morality questions at you as you're an AI trying to ponder their existence and the consequences of various events.\n\nHonestly, the weakest part of this game in my opinion however, is the combat.  While it is cool, and it's a little hectic fighting a war of attrition, if you plan out your economy with the intent to build up an effective fighting force beforehand, it's a little trivial in the first few stages.  Also ran into a couple sequence breaks regarding conversations popping up out of turn which feel like bugs.

I bought this game because I saw 5 seconds of someone streaming it and they were in the phase \"ecopoiesis\" which was the name I was thinking of for a very similar game of my own design.

I think it would be literally easier to start over than to continue. \n\nMild spoilers ahead.\n\nThis situation is definitely my fault, because I wanted to play as a pacifist, and that's not really possible. I didn't pursue researching military technology because I didn't really care for that in this game. I was having a fine time trying to get my space tech tree up and building my economy.\n\nBut apparently it's not possible to avoid having to build some defensive military technology, and so now my economy is destroyed by constant waves of enemies, and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nThey win, and I lose, I guess. I find this frustrating because it's not the game I was expecting. I don't even know who the enemy is.\n\nApart from the storyline taking me places I wasn't hoping to go, I think this game is fairly well made. I like the visuals and most of the interface.\n\nBut I think there's some room for improvements there too, especially for a game that I think is focused on detailed economic production. Like I need to be able to debug why my food is going slow. Can I filter the production buildings to just food factories? Can I get some UI for what is causing the demolition sound effect? How about a finer grained priority system?\n\nTaking it all in, I guess I would recommend this game, but I don't know if I will come back to it.",

The only issue is that conversations can be skipped causing some serious immersion breaking when you're talking to someone about a conversation you haven't had with another character. Definitely needs worked on.\n\nIf you enjoy a more casual simulation game, definite buy. Otherwise check some gameplay out before deciding. I've completed one ending, and already considering my next play through, there's also a sandbox mode I'll be visiting so I can do a completion style run since based on various events through the game you can lock yourself out of points of interest.\n\nThe devs are actively working on the game, and have plans for future additions and polishing.

  "review": "This a pretty soft recommend. Its almost a neutral or maybe a soft non-recommendation, but a lot of the issues I have with the game stem from quality of life things that could be improved within a few patches. \n\nKeeping it simple, Per Aspera is a very pretty game with some really good gameplay and sound design. I spent a lot of the time that I played the game simply looking at the landscape and watching the water or grass slowly spread across the planet. I also found the voice acting to be very refreshing. Troy Baker in particular did a wonderful job as Dr. Nathan Foster and honestly I found myself wishing he would talk [i]more[/i]. The gameplay loop is very enjoyable as well and reminds me a lot of games like Satisfactory or Factorio. Build more mines and factories to expand the base, to find more resources, to build more mines and factories, to support more colonists, to research more things, to build better mines and factories... and also terraform the planet. One of the things that I think is worth mentioning is that I thought it was pretty neat watching how your road system develops. The game will auto-draw roads based on the best possible path between nodes, which ends up giving you some pretty cool spider-web-esque designs. Finally as, far as the story goes, I'd say it's pretty good. Without spoiling anything, it doesn't end up being as straight forward as you might think. Although it seems mostly linear, the game gives you a few options how to steer AMI on her mission to terraform Mars so you don't feel entirely on rails.\n\nAll that good stuff being said, allow me to address some of the things I didn't like. I should also mention that I haven't fully completed the story, but that is mostly because of the issues I have with the game. \nAgain, keeping it simple, the story comes off as feeling very disjointed once you get into the late game. I ran into multiple times where characters would be conversing with AMI as if they were friends, despite having not yet met them. One good example being where I was pretty well into the endgame, having just made a pretty drastic choice with big implications, only to have a voice communication occur that was very obviously from the early/mid game. This is more than likely due to the open nature of the game, but the mission objectives don't exactly do a good job of pointing you towards where you should go. \nThis would be pretty forgiveable if the gameplay held up as well, but frankly it doesn't. Towards the mid game you start noticing that resources aren't being sent where they need to go as efficiently as they should be, thus factories and colonies aren't being supplied, lowering your productivity and research. A fair bit of this can be attributed to poor worker hub layout and a poor understanding of how workers interact with each other, but again the game doesn't really explain it to you that well. So much of it is trial and error, and even then you can only do so much. Hyperloops and road upgrades can help mitigate the logistics crisis you inevitably fall into, but road upgrades are so tedious and the late game so vast, that you eventually just run out of capacity. \nThere are also a ton of minor things that irk me. Why can I not paint an area to upgrade my roads? Why can I not upgrade my worker hubs to support more drones? Why can I not choose what areas worker hubs service?  Why is it that building tool tips keep popping up and blocking me while I'm trying to place buildings? What is with the AI building roads at extreme angles and through buildings when it could obviously go straight? And the big one, why do I not get refunded the resources spent upgrading roads when I delete the building they were connected to and, consequently, the roads along with it?\n\nAs I said, this game is wonderful. There is a certainly a lot to love about it and I can definitely see this evolving into a series that I come back to over the years. I just think there's some tinkering to be done in the tutorial, story progression, and gameplay department to get it over some of these bumps.\n\nAs a final rating, I'd say wait for a sale on this one.",

  "review": "I tried liking the game and not believing the reviews, but alas, after playing for 14 hours straight and doing pretty well (or so I thought), I got screwed over by the game for not building my base in the only proper and optimal way that this game sees fit.\n\nThe upsides:\n- The game is quite beautiful in terms of presentation and has some nice top-tier voice acting.\n- It is really cool to see the planet change bit by bit before your eyes as you progress.\n- Quite unique in terms of gameplay\n\nThe Problems:\n- My main problem with the game is the simulation. It is janky, completely unpredictable and it is impossible to know if you are doing well or not because of several reasons, mainly - the way that workers are allocated to tasks. You may be stuck in a situation where your entire base is slowly dying and you unable to fix it because the workers close to the worker factory refuse to carry the resources and you have to just sit there and watch your worker count go down further. And the worst thing is that I don't think this problem can be resolved without a major redesign of the game or just getting rid of worker decay entirely. The simulation is also unstable - [spoiler] The first enemy base just died by itself without me attacking it even once. [/spoiler]\n- The UI while slick and pretty, is barely functional. After playing for a while I still didn't understand what \"90% load\" mean when working with those stupid drones. I like the graphs and the stats on resources but some alerts would go a long way. (Maybe show some stats that imply what the problem is with my system - show me an alert if it takes a long time to carry the resources from mining spots to production or show me a warning if there is too much work to do and I gotta build more hubs - painting the area red and stating that the load is high doesn't indicate problems with my build.). \n- The bugs are making the experience frustrating. There are mid-game mechanics (such as hyperloops) which have not been properly QA'ed and are, in general, janky and annoying to interact with. The idea is awesome but they are unnecessarily difficult to build and use. I got stuck in a situation where a bunch of workers tried to supply the resources to a hyperloop to link it to a different loop and trying to dismantle the building at the same time. It ended up just killing my minibase because the workers got stuck moving the same piece of carbon and steel around until the point they all decayed into oblivion.\n- The story. it's cool and but it is annoying - the out-of-order chatter, characters referencing the events you haven't even learned about yet, real stupid mistakes with the science (how does one increase the level of carbon dioxide by air-braking a methane asteroid AND WHY IS THERE JUST ONE ASTEROID? [spoiler] or how does one add shields on the assault bots by applying a software update? [/spoiler])\n- WHY CAN'T I PUMP THE WATER FROM THE OCEANS?!\n[spoiler] - The combat is got awful. Should'a just cut it. [/spoiler]\n\nWill revisit it later, when it has been thoroughly patched and after a couple of DLC's. There's a foundation of a great game there, but (Gordon Ramsay Appears) \"It's fucking raw!!\"\n",

  "review": "After finishing a play through on the hardest difficulty, I have to say: This is not a colony builder, this is not an rts. This is a resource management-RPG. Everything is a resource, the aluminium, the iron, the colonists. What is important is to find more and more, while developing your character, literally. You are an infant AI, learning to be a grown-up. Everything in this game serves that agenda. If you approach it as a colony builder, you won't like it. [spoiler]The combat, is a minor inconvenience, just another part of resource management, the chances of you dying (once you figure out that you can move the combat drones, and don't have to build a tower every 5 feet) is 0.[/spoiler] \nYou have to approach this game from the perspective of story telling and making a character. If you do that I'm sure you'll have fun, deciding whether to be the arbiter of peace, or the genocidal villain, is what the game is about. Both having direct routes, each decision having a logical path that you discover as you play.\nThe end game can get pretty slow, so don't worry about slowing down your mission for the sake of the story too much, like I did. You have plenty of time to get everything you want done. It can get pretty boring after you finish with the story aspect otherwise.",

The negative thing about this game is that it needs some QoL improvements (like checking if the mission was completed by the player earlier when given). Also, there is absolutely nothing to do once you terraform Mars. There is a promise to terraform other planets in the solar system, but nothing in the game as for now. Maybe in future expansions.

  "review": "The best description of this game I have is that it feels a lot like someone took some of the economy mechanics of offworld trading company is bolted on the combat from google ai challenge planet wars to it. The game succeeds a lot more in telling a story, something strategy games rarely do, There are major pitfalls and challenges to giving the player a nonlinear story, meaning they can get ahead or behind in aspects you want them to but generally speaking I was fine with this pitfall.\n\nI honestly haven't cared as much about a crafted narrative (cutscenes, etc) in a strategy game since age of mythology?\n\nMajor bonuses of this game:\n\n+ Great story. I chose the \"good\" path although I think there's a fair bit of moral ambiguity between the three paths. Even though it is a crafted experience, the nonlinear pathing in it is both a bonus and negative.\n+ The early game has a really tight gameplay loop. Basically before you need to start upgrading roads. Honestly the drones should upgrade roads as they see fit. It should be something the player never needs to touch.\n+ It handles logistics much better than the anno series and warring. Instead of it being inventory limited on logistics it's rate limited which is both more realistic and satisfying.\n\nMajor problems with the game that may change:\n\n- The late game feels lack luster, I heard that there were forests but they never showed up in my game, only lychen.\n- The military portions do not feel challenging enough? This is probably because I overbuilt military not knowing my enemy strength, which made the economy harder.\n- The difficulty of managing the economy needs to be ramped down and the difficulty of the military needs to be ramped up. Getting over +2k settlers seems implausible even on easy.",

  "review": "I came to this game looking for a Mars terraforming simulator. I'm sorry to say that this game doesn't scratch that itch, although it probably comes closer than any other game (except Terraforming Mars, but that's too abstracted to really count).\n\nI suspect that the developers might view this game as being about the narrative, with terraforming Mars as more of a setting. Unfortunately, although the story has some good parts, it's also let down by the fact that it's very easy to trigger parts of the story out of order and have characters act as though certain things either have or haven't happened. I've only had one play-through, but I strongly suspect that there is basically one meaningful choice in the game -- this is very much an on-the-rails experience and not so much choose-your-own-adventure.\n\nThe gameplay is ultimately pretty rudimentary. I had hoped to dig into logistics and production chains (love Factorio, just to give you a sense of where I'm coming from), but they end up being fairly shallow. I could imagine optimizing the process, but the UI doesn't make it easy and ultimately there just isn't a need because it's so straightforward. I played on medium difficulty, so it's possible that optimization is more crucial on the hard difficulty but honestly that just sounds really tedious.\n\nThere is a \"military\" component to the game, but it's even more shallow than the terraforming and the best I can say about it is that the AI is bad enough that you can get through it pretty quickly.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I still do! There is a lot of room for improvement, and the devs have certainly said that they intend to keep working on. Frankly, I'm not sure this game was ready to leave early access -- the core game loop is there, but... it's just not that fun. Hopefully they make enough changes that I can recommend it, but until then save your money.",

  "review": "I am very mixed on this recommendation. Overall, I liked the story, the characters were decent, and the voice acting was much better than I expected. The base building is very satisfying to see the end result with a fantastic visual aspect.\n\nThat said, I am mixed because: the game itself is really wonky. You are ostensibly on Mars to terraform it, however that goal is secondary to your own survival. Most of the time I found progressing through the terraforming requirements wasn't important, and took my time doing it. This ludo-narrative dissonance wouldn't be so bad, except the way you progress in the game is tedious.\n\nAll resource deposits run out, which means your only survival strategy is to constantly expand. Expanding is critical, as later game projects require too many resources. Setting up secondary bases, and then linking them to your primary base, is all you will do in this game. And the tools for doing that will leave you wanting. You will just power/worker/maintaince/storage walk in a giant line to the base you just slapped down to link them so you can feed your primary base.\n\nEach base you create? It will do the exact same bootstrapping process you had done from the beginning. Every single time. Managing production quotas is impossible, though there are plenty of tools for visualizing how your production is failing. Not much you can do to effect change.\n\nAs the game goes on, performance drops, and the number of resources and robots you needs climbs fast. You need to constantly be expanding to afford all the projects, keep your colonists alive, and more. It becomes a real chore.\n\nHere are some improvements that would have a big impact:\n\n1) Remote bases are not fun to manage. Starting with more drones on a new base, linking power over greater distances, and having more starting resources on the new base (that don't need buildings) would reduce the repetition. \n\n2) I want to set per-region resource min/max, not per base. Once I had 40 bases or more, I don't want to go through each to manually set resources max, or turning off the steel factory at each base that I needed to get that outpost through the bootstrap phase. Being able to define a \"region\" of linked bases and setting production quotas would help.\n\n3) The grind is too long. You need thousands of carbon, iron, and more resources for various projects. I wasn't even sure the defense network was necessary. The story hinted an attack would come, but once built, the network was never \"tested\", so it felt pointless. The space elevator was underwhelming for its cost.\n\n4) Space ports should be nameable, and clickable through the mission selector. The dropdown is too small.\n\n5) Managing pop influx was frustrating. You have a small window to remember to cancel more pop from coming in. You can \"cheat\" this by turning off the space port, forever freezing the colonist ship in place, and also locking up your space port. Just let me set a max pop or something and have the ship make its own trips, or anything than the current way it works which is frustrating.\n\n6) If I have hyperloops, why do colonists take extremely slow airships? Waiting for a colonist ship to spend *months* moving to a new, story required outpost (of which there are many!) is agonizing when I have a globe spanning hyperloop network that can transport water in a few in-game days.\n\n7) Upgrading roads is tedious. If I remove a building in between (so as to free up building slots), the upgraded roads are removed.\n\n8) Terraforming has no in-game benefit or drawback. It doesn't affect wind or solar output (shouldn't more atmosphere make wind turbines better? Solar worse? Should the mirrors make solar better?). Water on the planet isn't drinkable, apparently. Forests and animals aren't food. By the time you can get open air bases or whatever, the game is past its welcome in terms of grind, and the bases before then can support more pop than I can deliver resources to, let alone generate enough water/food/chemicals.\n\n9) Losing pop has no discernible impact on the game. If you starve your people, they just peacefully leave. No impact on the AI whose only job is to...make Mars for humanity. Yes, it makes research slow, but you'll be spending so much time grinding base expansions and other objectives that it doesn't matter. The characters won't even remark on hundreds of pop leaving.\n\n10) The only cool tech in the tree are space elevators and hyperloops. Everything else is underwhelming (or just simply required, and thus neutral). Military tech is the least inspiring. \n\n11) New-game plus would be wonderful to experience the other stories. For now, it is too much grind.\n\n12) The required amount of sprawl, while obviously carries a strong story component, feels overly forced and annoying. It makes expansion feel necessary only for the story, rather than the stated purpose of your character, which is to terraform. I suppose this ties into the feeling that terraforming is only a goal, and loosely ties into all the events and things happening.\n\nI know I had a lot of criticism to provide, and I really did enjoy my time with the game. But I had hoped for more, and these many flaws prevent me from playing it again, rather than spoiling the experience I had.",

  "review": "I took a bit of time to think how I should write this review, after playing through the game. So if you want a detailed version read bellow. Tl;Dr 8/10 beautiful graphics and music, more for relaxing gameplay, if you are looking for a colony builder that\u2019s semi idle this is the game otherwise I recommend looking for other games.\nBeware gameplay spoilers ahead!!!!\n\n\n\nNow the long story:\n\nThe game has truly stunning views and music, the atmosphere of the situation can truly take you to any sci-fi fanatics\u2019 heaven, sadly the game part does not deliver such a \u201cpunch\u201d. The game is a casual style strategic resource manager with one problem almost 0 resources. They show you hot spots of recourses and the maximum amount you can find in them is around 10k of that recourse in cluster that contain from 500 \u2013 2000 after that you are screwed if you can\u2019t quickly establish a route to another hot spot, while recourses that you discover like uranium, can be so far away that you will never reach them, and you will never use it or the tech that requires it. Now the tech tree some parts are vital, like nitrogen import (since you can\u2019t get it any other way), and some tech will never be touched (no reward for using it other than just having it) the army tech is one such example. The tech tree is limited would wish for such tech as deep drilling or something resembling it for infinite or near infinite recourse production in late game. Now about getting RP (research points) don\u2019t go to ? for the recourse just build colony\u2019s much more efficient, don\u2019t need special placement, generate more than 10 times more, the only benefit of the ? is the lore you get. You would think what more can be wrong with the game, the combat OMG the combat, you get an opponent that comes out of nowhere(also disappears into nowhere) with an army so big that he can destroy you in a few minutes if you don\u2019t throw your resources at that moment into defense,  which sits idle(using up energy and resources) for a long time till he reappears a long time later at which point your army is so big you just remove him from the face of mars in a second do to always living in fear before, since the appearance and disappearance of the enemy comes as a surprise with no warning. Now the tech tree of the army is one of the biggest in the game but used only just for 2 combats, which brings me to question why have an enemy in the first place. To sum up if you\u2019re a casual gamer looking for a Zen game and never wanting to truly spend hours or days on paper planning to just be disappointed you found your game, if you\u2019re a hardcore strategy game fanatic with tens of city builders and strategy games in library run away, you will be mad at this game, you will rage, you will want to delete it, just because you ran out of Iron or aluminum or any other resource and the closest instance of it is on the other side of the planet and there is no way you will reach it and even if you reach it and mistime when your enemy appears well kiss your hard work goodbye as it blows up to an enemy you could not expect or just break down from not enough repair drones which need the resource in the first place to be built. To finish this review, I am truly sad the game is what it is and not what I expected it to be a realistic mars transformation game. But I am willing to wait a year, a decade, to give the devs time to fix it, make it better if not, well it is going to be just another game in the shelf.\n",

  "review": "If you've played titles like Surviving Mars, or Offworld Trading Company, this game will feel very familiar. Setup critical infrastructure, manufacturing supply chains, balance your colony's needs with your resources needed for your special projects. As far as the formula is concerned, Per Aspera nails it... almost.\n\nIronically the thing they added to the formula is the weakest: Combat in this game is [i]simple[/i], woefully so in fact. The initial introduction to combat puts you at a significant disadvantage. A disadvantage that, if not prepared for, will leave you in a sort of permanent lurch, eventually collapsing even a well designed infrastructure backbone. Add to the fact that your defensive infrastructure has limited range compared to the enemy's offensive capabilities and their unlimited, roaming assaults, and there's no real way to recover from a penetrating attack in time to stave off the next one.\n\nAnd this sucks, really, because their storywork is excellent, and manages to hook you almost immediately to the needs of the mission, and the deep philosophical questions about Artificial Intelligence, told rather uniquely via the first person. The voice acting is impeccable at delivering the emotional weight of the various situations posed, the writing is believable, and overall the gameplay loop that backstops all of this is tried, tested, and satisfying.\n\n I sincerely hope that the depth to the combat system improves so that there amounts some form of counterplay and pre-emptive buildup. As it stands right now I can't recommend this game, but am very interested to see how the systems evolve over time. Hopefully the developers can put the same quality and loving effort, that they've given to the other systems, into combat.",

  "review": "Sadly there is not a MAYBE option in doing a review when it comes to Recommendations. This game should have a MAYBE option... simply because this game will very quickly become boring for city builders. The only thing going for it right now is the promise that the developers will work on new content in the new year. \n\nMuch like Frostpunk once you resolve the mechanics on how to get what resource at what time - the story is dead. All you have left is to explore the areas with more mindless buildings which will place more pressure on your resources and so the circle perpetuates. However the mechanics seems to have flaws BUT the dev's picked these up and made some very quick hotfixes, which is highly exciting to see as so many games are dumped on the market with no support. Lets hope this continues as this is where the potential lies. \n\nThe Game as is - is a masterclass in graphics. That said - there is a lot of room for improvement to find buildings  currently only possible to zoom out to find the icons or literally clicking on every building - I might add some of you will memorise what each building looks like and would find this easier - I am just to lazy and what to sort or use left right arrow to scroll through buildings. Sadly the graphics do not support the research and the end game is disappointing. \n\nTalking about research - it is a very long process which is unfortunate as you will find days where you cant do much until the next research is done. It is also not helpful when you are not told how you can speed it up, noteably adding more colonists seems to increase research output. Which brings me to the non-existent HELP File or Guidance. Seriously?? - the knowledge base just tells you about the building, but not what it requires, what the production chain is and what the building can do or not do... This naturally results in many re-starts. \n\nThe story of the AI in normal mode... is awesome, however I would have preferred an option where the AI goes rogue. The outcome of questions irrespective which you answered seems the same which is disappointing and very early on in the game you get the option to go \"bad\" but this option is not forthcoming. This would have made for a better game enslaving the colonists and determine their fate.  The sandbox mode is just tedious with no instructions and no missions. Lost of room to improve here. \n\nOverall this is great game with excited developers. BUT if you have limited funds - wait for a sale. The full price is not worth it. Hopefully new content will justify the cost. Especially when this game will continue the story beyond terraforming and becomes a game of logistics, city building and potential interstellar wars. \n\nThis game is 7/10.",

  "review": "The idea of mankind making Mars its second home has been brewing in our collective consciousness. As we finally approach this incredibly milestone, I feel inspired to play in a Martian sandbox. For the last few years; I've been following numerous games as they attempt to capture this concept. I'm sure you all know the usual suspects.\n\nWhen I find a game is focused on glorified battle I tend to immediately eliminate it. War and killing does not inspire me. I want to imagine a future where human horizons are expanding and I hope we are getting better at doing this without violence. So I'm looking toward the survival against the elements direction. How can mankind use our intelligence and technology to expand our horizons? Similarly I don't want a game where the mechanics get in the way of the sense of wonder and progress.\n\nI have found Per Aspera to be a deeply developed realization of my Mars play dreams; with caveats. There is a constant sense of struggle against the harsh reality of Mars' natural world. The balance between this struggle and the joy that comes from constant \"little wins\" as you build mines, factories, supply chains, and housing is addictive. Per Aspera is deep enough in the details to keep your brain working, but not so overwhelming that you cannot see the big picture of what you are accomplishing.\n\nBy beginning with a fully open planet that is accurately proportioned from topographic data; you begin in awesome desolation and wilderness. By choosing sandbox mode, you actually have the option to start your adventure from anywhere on the planet you desire. If you prefer the story, there is a complex and controversial one that awaits you.\n\nI have to give a huge shoutout to the amazing artists that must have spent years perfecting each building and thousands of animations. Per Aspera allows you to instantly zoom from a single \"worker\" transport, out to buildings and roadways, all the way back out into space. It feels very much like Google Earth, but with the ability to create the cities and networks you see below you. You can choose to simply lay out your designs from above in an old-school sim city style, but if you take the time to zoom in you can see every building has a lot of character and life in it.\n\nI hope I have made it clear that this game is very ambitious. Here is where the difficulty lies. Compromises must be made to engineer something like this; and compromises are almost always controversial. Here is one example: Building and terraforming Mars is going to take multiple human generations, and the conceit the developers chose was to have you play as an everlasting AI overseeing development from above. This then opened up a story involving AI, Mars, humanity, and the interplay between these. There are twists and turns in this story that are certain to surprise, and will surely please some and frustrate others. \n\nThe amount of complexity necessary to model and manage a functioning system on a planetary scale is high. I feel like the developers have generally pulled this off, but there are certainly bugs. Multiple patches have been forthcoming in the weeks since release, and we are told these will continue in the new year. There will be periods of frustration for most players when playing even the latest release. If you can find the patience to work through these frustrations, they do not break the game. I have found that I could work around any issues with enough patience and creativity. The patches so far have made progress on fixing the most frustrating issues. There are also reasonable limits on the number of structures that can extend around the planet. You cannot fill the surface of Mars with cities at this time; but you can create world circumnavigating arteries and infrastructure. This may be an opportunity for the developers to improve and expand the game's capabilities in the future.\n\nYou will need to enjoy sim city type games to enjoy this game. There will be periods of hours where you will be planning and managing resources similarly to those style games. But I feel this makes sense, and fits well with the Mars story. Humanity's expansion beyond Earth is likely to be a lot more about managing resources and supply chains than anything else. Per Aspera does a good job making this side of things fun. The developers constantly mix things up with new exploration and terraforming objectives. Of all the sim city style games; this is the first since the very original that truly sucked me in for endless hours.\n\nI am very impressed with this game, and believe it will become well loved over time. I certainly enjoyed both the story and sandbox modes. The game is also reasonably priced in comparison to its depth and replayability. It is clear the amount of art and development work that went into Per Aspera is on par with much higher priced games. \n\nIf you are excited about mankind's expansion to Mars; Per Aspera is a wonderful experience that will likely pull you in for many hours.\n\nI highly recommend Per Aspera.\n\n",

  "review": "I was really digging this game right off the bat. The aesthetics, the fantastic voice acting, and the hints at a larger story about AI consciousness are great to see, especially in a colony builder. Unfortunately, the game mechanics start falling apart once you reach the midgame and become pretty unbearable if you want to finish out the story. I ended up using Cheat Engine to reach the end in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nPart of why my played time is fairly high is that I was playing on the harder difficulty. The first time I reached the midgame, I cranked up the time multiplier to let some tech research finish... only to essentially have a colony collapse spiral when I realized I'd run out of resources to make maintenance drones. I figured ok, cool, I let the system get out of control and it's a neat clockwork thing that will break if you push it too far. I'll just start over and pay more attention next time.\n\nBut no, it turns out that what actually had happened was the drones that carry your resources around your base, e.g., from the iron mine to the steel factory to the parts factory etc., have really bad AI. When you're first starting out with a small base you don't notice it, but when you've got a base that's essentially a graph with 300+ nodes and 1500+ edges, the drones' favorite things to do become: 1. carry a single unit of a resource back and forth between two buildings that need that resource, and 2. decide to bring a unit of a resource from the other side of the planet to the factory that needs it, rather than taking it from a building right next door.\n\nSince this doesn't affect small bases as much, this wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't force you to expand in order to both survive and advance the story. Resource deposits are finite and so you have to keep finding more to keep up with your colony's needs, and eventually the story objectives devolve into a series of objectives that are either 1) expand your base to this distant part of the planet to set up a research lab, or 2) complete projects at your spaceport that take tons of resources.\n\nIt really would be a grind even if resources moved efficiently around your base, but as it is I can't imagine finishing the story without many hours of repetitive micromanagement.\n\nAside from these mechanical issues, it feels like the narrative is pretty well-tuned at the beginning of the game, but again things fall apart later on. Dialog prompts start appearing out of order, referring either to events that have not yet happened, or reflecting on something that happened hours ago as if it had just completed. Emotions will be extremely strained with a character in one conversation, and in the very next one they're as cheerful as ever, as though nothing happened.\n\nThere is a really cool game in here, I just hope they're able to bring it out in future updates.",

The fact that you keep having to \"mine\" for food and water after you've generated water on the surface and have plants & animals growing makes absolutely no sense. You have to keep hunting for a supposedly limited resource when you have acres of farmland and lakes covering the planet. This makes it nearly pointless to have anything beyond the tiniest human colonies which seems to defeat the entire point of the endgame: Terraforming.\n\nI sincerely hope there are more large design changes coming to this game and not just bug fixes.

My experience with campaign mode so far:\n\nIn general the game feels unpolished and unbalanced.\u00a0\nLet's take worker drones for example, to run a mid game economy you need around 40 of them and still need to put priority on steel/electronic factories.\u00a0\nThe thing is that a single drone hub building only increases worker drone capacity by 1, so you need 40 drone hubs....I have literally fields of those things, I have more drone hubs than solar fields just to provide the\u00a0needed workforce in mining heavy areas. And this with level 1 tech factories/mine speeds.\nThe priority system is very basic, binary even, you can raise the priory of a building...and that it (also there is \"allocation\" of resources\u00a0per resource\u00a0but shhhh - I told you nothing about it, the game tells nothing about it too)\n\nSpeaking\u00a0about technology...\nThere is only one and only one tech related to worker drones - faster roads,\u00a0that is, for a price of your whole midgame economy you can create a super expensive\u00a0highway from one end to the other...still not tried, since it is SUPER expensive.\u00a0\nBy the way, the game does not tell you how much distance is between factories in kilometers until you research\u00a0the faster roads tech.\n\nThe other technology you can research\u00a0is mostly garbage.\nFactory production speed is not worth it since you can build a second factory and it will be way way more efficient than upgrading existing one for a price of 3 factories just to get\u00a0+50% production speed.\u00a0\nUpgrading mining can be beneficial since there is a limited amount of resources on the map...and you will run out of resources eventually.\nAnd by the way resources are randomly generated, even in campaign, if you are unlucky and did not have a second aluminium\u00a0resource\u00a0node then you are going to stare at the screen for twice as long without being able to do anything.\n\nNot sure how I feel about the terraforming technologies.... space mirrors? asteroid trapping? eh....well, the game just advanced me to terraforming stage 2 in a couple of\u00a0years with me doing pretty much nothing -\u00a0launched black dust to cover the poles, once, that is level 0 tech.\nThe storyline alternative is to launch nukes at the poles using an old chinese space program\u00a0silo...that's fine, but you have to be extremely\u00a0persistent in pursuing this option - lets see, first you need to unlock the sector with the silo, that's to launch\u00a0a satellite\u00a0over it...then you need to research\u00a0more launch\u00a0sites and build a new one for a fortune...then you will need build the base from the ground\u00a0up (exactly like the first time) until you get colonists to the silo....compared to a single launch\u00a0of black dust covering that is like 10x the effort in both resources and time.\n\nAlso descriptions are inconsistent in the tech tree and what you actually get number wise - looks like an attempt on last minute balancing before release.\n\nAlso also the game is buggy on basic level - more than once I seen worker drone in traffic hell, hauling a piece of steel between two points back and forth for months....",

(This last point could be forgiven, except that the game makes no effort to explain or demonstrate how workers prioritize moving resources. The tools provided to visualize how over/underutilized your workers are also don't seem to correlate to reality at all.)\n\nI also have some balance concerns related to resources being depleted very quickly, or being blocked before you can exploit them. The latter feels particularly unfair because you don't have the ability to efficiently store large quantities of resources, and if you rush to exploit them, your infrastructure will be destroyed as the planet undergoes changes.\n\nThe narrative is really interesting so far, and the visuals and concept are very appealing, but this needs more time in the oven. \n\nI'll be sure to update this if there are patches.",

Ironically enough, I felt more immersed in terraforming Mars with these flaws than without. Your workers aren't precise, you can accidentally tap yourself out of resources, you can accidentally re-prioritize activities leading to a a slow death via decay as your workers fail to sustain themselves. While it definitely has flaws, for a terraforming simulator it was beautiful. I personally liked that you can accidentally hard lock yourself in the campaign a number of times, as it felt lore-friendly. After all, [spoiler] the Martian landscape is littered with the remains of AIs and humans who have met similar fates, [/spoiler] the process of terraforming is very vulnerable to failure, particularly in its infancy as it gets established on the planet. Game isn't perfect, but the narrative is interesting and I found it to be an experience I, as a space nerd, have a hard time putting into words. Seeing the oxygenated glow of atmosphere as plants crept across Mars had me wearing a cheesy grin as the work started paying off. I could see why it isn't for everyone and I can see why the city-builder crowd it griping. This game isn't about min/maxing and micro-managing your resource drones. If you're looking for a precise city management sim then I wouldn't recommend this game. However, in the 4 days I have owned the game, there have already been two patches to help with these QoL issues. However, if like me, you bought this game to [b] Terraform Mars [/b] then I'd recommend it. If you're unsure, wait till it's on sale.

A lot of the responses don't make a lot of sense either.\nThe mysterious things that were happening all just seem to stem from people being assholes and ignoring long term repurcussions and I eventually got really annoyed with the lead colonist who displayed behaviour unfitting of her position.\nThe logistics management all falls apart later game, you will have colonists needing water and a drone standing next to a full water mine not doing anything. Hyperloops do little to help with this as only 1 resource can pass through them at a time and there is no reliable way to transport resources en mass over distances.\nThe Tech tree becomes kind of boring as you realise all you effort into terraforming mars cant be harnessed. Want to use some of that water on the planet instead of arbitrary water mines? No technology for scooping water out of the sea sorry. Want to grow some plants for food for the colonists? Oh no those plants just convert CO2 to O2 they are not for eating, get back on the chemical and water diet please.\nThe Goals to terraform the planet fall apart towards the end, there are many feedback loops you can get stuck in, flooding the oceans and loosing access to minerals, having the plants and lichen convert too much CO2 to O2.\n\nI really wanted to recommend this game and did enjoy it for the first 6 or so hours but it left a sour taste in my mouth as the whole game seems to fall apart later on.",

Forexample: \n\nMy silicon mines are stuck with full mining stock piles, but my electrical factories are starving of silicon, yet no drone hubs nearby is doing anything about it; unless i hit the prioritization button which basically says all drones should be on the task which remove them from doing something else equally important somewhere else in my huge base. \n\nSudden a mine runs out of something and something else starts lacking, because i was too busy trying to fix another chain and not expanding my base to the next nodes.\n\nIts micro management game without nuance and more about just placement, that its obnoxiously slow yet absolutely chaotic at higher speeds.\n\nCombat becomes just blobing up a huge assault drone fleet with defense towers here and there. and is definitely not the main focus.\n\nAt the start the game is manageable, but as you start expanding between sectors and have to balance your atmosphere composition with microing the absolutely massive base which will eventually crawl down the gameplay as you forced to play at slower speeds or risk death spirals.\n\nSuggestions\n- Give us the ability to set alerts for specific levels of production or when efficiency for a set of buildings go down or if resource production levels fall below a level, especially ability to slow down the game if something is triggered. We are an AMI after all.\n- Conditional Power off / Power On of buildings.\n- Stockpile management needs a lot more work especially when once starts working with large units of resources\n- Allow us to assign drone hubs to specific buildings instead of area.\n- Should be able to assign mines/factories to stock piles instead of a resource, to avoid drones from going all over the place\n- No way to convert oxygen back to carbon dioxide. This should be simple, we already do it here :) and stockpiles of carbon is available. Currently too easy to get stuck at 95% oxygen and going into a death spiral since everything is on FIRE and silicon and chemicals get completely drained\n- Give us the ability to have multiple graphs of  resources up at the same time.\n- More variation in music... it gets a tad monotonious.\n\nBugs\n- I can get calls from the same character while I'm still talking to the same character. I get these are conversations that may have happened, considering the timeframe. Slow the game down perhaps when such have been accepted to avoid such?\n- Research completions interrupts story elements and can get jarring.\n- Story elements do not stop the game from running in the background. Had all the psych evals WHILE i was in 16x mode and I think that screwed me up in the end game on my second play through attempt",

The AI does seem to have issues. But i am wondering if its cause i don't have enough drones for all the tasks at the base and the little guys are going crazy to do tasks.

My suggestion would be to have a 'slower' start at the beginning (tho the first wave was on point: if you did not prepare - i did not- the enemy retreat after wrecking havock, but not total destruction. That's a stark reminder to get prepare for war, and it's fine!).\nHowever, I would:\n - Make AMI self-reflect on 'I should [b] really [/b] arm myself'\n - Make AMI self-reflect on 'Well, I should also [b] really [/b] consider my maintenance bot as part of my defense system'\n\nThis would nudge the player in the right direction. The first attack as the second 'warning' shot is really good, but I would allow more time between this attack and the next one.\nIt was a really hard challenge to just get my maintenance up and running again, especially because at this stage you already start to be lacking resource if you didn't crawl-xpand , and I consider myself as a seasoned player of the genre.[/spoiler]\n\nOther than that, the idea of the story-driven gestion game is astonishingly brillant and the hard sci-fi mixed with AI 'sentientness' and Mars colonization is just amazing.\n\nOverall, a really good game, in need of some balance I reckon, but that's normal for every game.

The end game is just clicking special project and waiting 15 minutes.\n\n- The balance is out of wack with colonies.\n- No reason to build crater cities as they have lower RP/resource ration.\n-The colony needs 10 water food for one research cycle but its seems to fast as cant seem to supply the city fast enough. Have enough food close by but that needs 20 drone ticks to supply the colony.\n- Late game building takes really long time as there seems to be bug with the blue new road placement. As you place building  next to 4 already build building it will take some time to blue roads to form. Was at about 1000 buildings. Started to break up my connections and made more hyper loops for small distances. It seemed help a bit.\n- Why are there no upgraded worker hubs or workers. Carry 2 stacks but slower?\n- No way to mine the formed ice or use the sea for water.\n- Still need search for ice from martian soil when you have liquid water lake next to the colony.\n-Combat fits the story but is quite bother. Why cant have auto hunt attacking drones? \n- Food is chemical and water sink? They have not heard of recycling? Could be used to balance the colonies. Larger colonies are easier to supply but have waste, but smaller one need less resources but need to have more workers supplying.\n- Storage building is just bad? Can only hold 100 of each type so if want to mine 800 iron from flood area fast need to have 8 storage buildings for that one mine.\n\nThe game is great at start that breaks down from having the whole planet. It is very cool to look at Mars and transform it but at same time it feels quite useless as use only 10% planet. Well 60%? will be under ice/water in the mid game so does limit it.\n\n\nFor now If you only want to play the story its fine game, but the game will break down. For now would wait for them to fix the game. It is quite shame as the story is great.\nThe terraforming feels bit too fast as water/ice will hide quite many interesting lore from the old research missions.",

I haven't completed the game, but it's satisfying to watch your little base expand to cover expansive areas of the map (the entirety of which is visible at all times, giving you a sense of grandeur).  It starts with simple systems that grow more complex over time, presenting a new challenge around every corner.  I feel as if I'm still in the tutorial seven or eight hours in.  \n\nThis is most likely one of those multiple-playthrough kind of games.  You can even start a sandbox game if you won't want to mess around with a plot.  However, I'm really drawn into the philosophical gravity of Per Aspera.  It's voiced well enough, but not tremendously so.  The fact that you, the player, embody a sentient AI constantly pondering existential questions in between directives is a fascinating way to add tempo to an otherwise long series of dry spells of gameplay.  I still don't know who the bad guy is even this far into playing it.\n\nIt's my kind of game.  Slowly unfolding and slowly gaining speed until the tasks you sat and waited on for minutes on end are strung together into a delicate dance, with the risks increasing each time.  You won't find complex combat or twitch gaming here.  This one's for the old folks who shake their fists at those kids and their games nowadays.

When there is a giant ocean slowly forming over the surface of the planet. The fact that the space elevator isn't used for something cooler then being a spaceport that checks off the special requirements box for some oribital missions. The game also gets super boring once most of the story is finished with you just sitting there waiting to research the final thing you need to finish the last stage of terraforming. Which takes forever to research because depending on how good your rng was you might not have enough water to create food easily. So your research might look like a rollercoaster as you go from 40 years eta to 2 years eta and back again in the manner of minutes.

Story beats have pretty much all played out at this point, and even the most sprawling colony will take years to research late-game techs - colonies (which contribute research) are strongly gated by the availability of water and chemicals, to the point where the flow rate of resources just can't keep up. Your mars colonies are also usually forced into disjoint cities - with no way to tell which resources are low in which separate landing site. The combat also seemed really simplistic - I was struggling to support my colonies, struggling to bootstrap research outposts, but still won each combat scenario only losing 2-3 buildings the whole game, with minimal commitment to the military research branch. \n\nThe bad: \nGames (more than other media) cannot just *have* a story, it needs to relate that story to the experience of playing the game. None of the story beats have gameplay consequences - e.g. you'll \"lose\" colonists to story events, without the colonist population actually decreasing. You'll be asked to question your own perceptions and judgement - without any consequences to the actual game. The main story is about beating an existential threat - but in gameplay terms, that threat paled in comparison to the anxiety of running out of resources, and frantically depleting entire hemispheres of the planet to sustain a 2k person colony. \n\nIn the end, just not very fun.",

  "review": "All in all the game is pretty okay-ish. But in its current state is sadly underwhelming for what was promised. I would give it a 5.5/10 which is too low for 30\u20ac\n\nI keep the positives short because they need no explanation.\n\nFirst the positives, the terraforming of mars feels nice, espacially the special projects. Also the ressource managment is in its foundation promising. The storyline is nice, with a few twist that keeps it intresting. The references are a good addition too and also quite funny to some degrees.\n\nBut the game has a few issues that add up to a state where I can't recomend the game right now:\n\n1. The ressource managment needs a bit more love. The stockpile isnt working right, sometimes you have thousands of a ressource but the workers ignore that and shut down the production of food because of that, only if you priotize that factories they get used up.\n2. The UI gets cluttered really fast, even with the lenses. After you have unlocked enough tech you see a marker for everthing, every ore, every geothermal vent, every place for domes, every building, etc.\nThere has to be a way to toggle those thing. We do I need to see where i can place a Dome when im placing electricity? \n3. Ressource counts. You have a little up and down arrow beside each ressource, so you can call if its trending down or up. But the arrows go down if a ressource is subtracted from storage and goes up if its added. So even if you produce 100 per minute surplus and one worker takes something out the arrow says trending down and then up again.\n4. Logisitcs just dont make sense. I've played managment and economy sims my whole life but I cant grasp my head around that one in this game and it simply doesnt get explained anywhere. Your robots are constantly overworked from the simplist things espacially later when you get tier 3 factories and mines. Your production and extraction get faster but the robots dont seem to hold up. Even with fastet roads and hyperlane. While your workers more on the outskirt are just staying in der huts and dont move anything, even tho there are plenty of ressoruces waiting to be put into storage.\n5. Expanding isnt fun. Thats the main issue with the game. Expanding is tedious and always the same. Overlap Circle of building range, overlap circle of power, overlap circle of maintance aaaand repeat. We have to do the same thing thrice. This system needs changing.\n\n\n",

There are quite a few bad design decisions that make the game very inconsistent, to say the least.\n\nIt is very easy to go too slow/fast with terraforming so that the dialogue makes no sense. Running out of one ressource while having a abundance of others is a common occurence too.\n\nThe logistics feel pretty bad/counterintuitive due to each robot only serving its own area, which means that it is VERY inefficient.\n\nBut the story overall is quite intriguing.\n\nI could see the game being elevated from ok to awesome with a few changes.

  "review": "[h1] A great way to burn the weekend before Cyberpunk! [/h1]\n\nPositives: \nThis game was an unexpected delight. I am amazed at how deep I got into the game this weekend and I'v only colonized maybe 15% of the surface of Mars. I had dreams this weekend of me obsessing over gathering resources and controlling drone loads. The concept, story, hell even the combat was compelling. I am always interested in how AI might interact with humans in different conditions. And I am still wondering about AMI's future after Mars is a better Earth than Earth is even today. Does she get transferred to Venus? Does she get packaged up and sent on a slower than light ship to prepare another planet for Human's arrival in 100 years? I cant wait for spoilers to come out and I hope there is someway to get an ending where AMI gets her freedom while also peacefully coexisting with humans on Mars.\n\nNeutral:\n1. I wish there were more complex production chains. The game only has \"Tier 1\" resources (meaning they take two raw or \"Tier 0\" resources and make a new one). I am so used to games like Anno where you can have something like 5 tiers of resources you need to manage production and consumption. \n\n2. There doesn't seem to be a way to get to resources once they are under water. So, if you start terraforming too soon alot of your easy to get to resources will be under water before they get used up. This provided an interesting mid-game challenge when half my base got flooded but now I have so many resources so close that I just CANT get to.\n\nThat said...if there was a \"wait for a patch or two\" review option, then I would select it.\n\nThe game needs some work. A few examples: \n1. There needs to be a way to manage stockpiles of resources. As it stands it seems kinda random where the resources go. Some how...they still get to where they need to be...eventually. But as it stands it is hard to impossible to figure out why factory X is running between 0% and 20% efficiency where as factory Y a few spaces over is running at 100%.\n\n2. There needs to be a way to toggle what icons are visible after you zoom out a bit. Too often did I queue up a Hyper Loop and go do something else while it builds, only to forget exactly where I placed it and having to hunt around for it to connect to the Hyper Loop Network.\n\n3. The triggers on the dialog need some work. They seem to come out of order more often than not. I'll get dialog triggers and not know what I did to cause them.  Worst, you will get dialog triggers for a quest branch that should no longer be possible to continue on. [spoiler] I went all Sky Net for one of my endings and was still getting dialog from my colonists all the while I was sending drones to cleanse the surface of their presence. And these weren't the \"oh god, why are you doing this, please stop\" dialog I was expecting. [/spoiler]\n\n4. Maybe I missed it but there seemed to be no way to access your combat squads with hot keys. You have to scroll ALLL the way over to your squads, then scroll ALLL the way over to where the enemies. Squads will merge if they happen to attack the same target and will return home if they dont find anything within 10 feet to attack they will start heading home without orders.\n\nI'll be putting this back on the virtual shelf while Cyberpunk consumes my next several weeks. But I hope after a few patches the rough edges will be filed off and this will become a great resource management sim.",

  "review": "As a big fan of Kim Stanley Robinson's book \"Red Mars\" this game's story was really enjoyable. While there isn't as much depth between the factions and interests in this game compared to the book, I am up to a point in the story where there 3 different forks that presumably determine the future fate of Mars. This isn't really even the main story though which seems to be about AMI's character development and her internal monologue and reflections are really interesting as a story telling device and allow you to get insight into her thoughts. One issue with the game though is that the story triggers seem to be associated with different actions you perform but do not have any sense of dependency or knowledge of previous interactions, this can lead to a lot of dialogue talking about plot arcs that either haven't happened yet or have already happened and been resolved.\n\nThe main attraction for the game for me was the terraforming aspects which take an appropriately long time and proceed in stages. Options are afforded to the player to control temperature, atmospheric composition and basic lifeforms (at least where I am at the moment). There are some cool interactions here with increasing the temperature at the poles with space mirrors which allowed my algae colonies to spread to a larger area in the northern ocean I had created. You can end up completing multiple terraforming stages this way as they are associated with certain atmospheric goals which seems a bit weird gameplay wise but is nice as an option to the player.\n\nAt points in the game you will need to make smaller bases that require you to remember the build order from the beginning, which becomes a bit boring after you have done it >5 times already. It would be nice if you could deploy smaller bases with more resources to speed this up later in the game. It's possible that this is something you can access later but I had not seen anything after ~12 hours into the campaign and around halfway through the tech tree. After setting up these bases it is very satisfying to connect them up to the main base however.\n\nI'm not certain how much this is an intentional design choice, but as the game progresses you will become increasingly starved for water which requires you to expand across the surface in search of it to sustain your colonies and terraforming processes. The game balance seems a little bit off, but resources being scarce does push the gameplay forward and allow you to disassemble older structures that become obsolete for resources. This plays quite well which making sure that your production facilities are close to raw resources to minimise traffic.\n\nThe combat is very underwhelming but I was more interested in the base building and terraforming aspects of the game. It seems to be there more in service of the narrative than as something that a lot of game development time was spent on.",

  "review": "Per Aspera is my new favourite Mars game. This game has the colony building of Surviving Mars, all be it without the need to micromanage individual colonists, but with all the science behind terraforming the red planet. It has the story element of many a good adventure game, and it almost feels like you are seeing swings towards destruction or coexistence. I won\u2019t give the story away but you play the role of a super intelligent machine named AMI and are both asked questions about and amass thoughts on your role in terraforming Mars alongside the role of the human colonists. There is obviously much influence gained from films like 2001 and it is nicely done in game.\n\n[u]Basic Premise[/u]\n\nPer Aspera, from Tl\u00f6n Industries,  is a colony management sim based on Mars in which you are terraforming the planet sometime in the late 2100s or early 2200s (the game may have said but I missed it). The game has a huge back story and lore foundation that makes for great reading and gets you right in to the setting of the game.\n\nPer Aspera is set on the most beautiful map of Mars I have ever seen in game. It might just be the most beautiful map I have seen in a game. You can zoom out and scan the entire surface of Mars, complete with all the labels of the area names of the red planet (Terra Sabaea, Elysium Planitia, Valles Marineris and Olympus Mons etc) and including a large number of lore information tags that show where past missions to Mars have been centred on in the universe that has been created for Per Aspera.\n\nThe map is complete with elevations and looks absolutely fantastic when you pan or flip the map around. It is a work of art.\n\nAs I said, you control an artificial intelligence called AMI and your job is to terraform the planet. To do that you start out by creating a basic infrastructure composed of mining and manufacture with elements ranging from carbon, aluminium and steel to water, chemicals and polymers. This is combined with the need to manage the logistics of the mission via management of power, drones, maintenance and resource scanning. You will build hubs to allow expanding a network of worker drones, maintenance depots to keep your network working at full ability and power it with solar panels and wind farms.\n\nThe next step is obviously to bring humans to Mars. They arrive via a huge spaceport and colonise the colonies and research bases you build. Research bases can be built on past colonisation attempts that are found via the scanning tools given to you.\n\nEventually you will start to research new technologies and begin the terraforming of the planet, but I have only just reached that point. It takes time to complete the setup; the mining, the manufacturing and the transporting of colonists, but this stage is far from boring.\n\n[u]Aesthetics[/u]\n\nWhilst Per Aspera doesn\u2019t feature ground breaking graphics, the game is very, very pretty. The style is that of a sort of line drawn pencil sketches, but I am no artist so there is probably a better description. As I said above, the map is stunning and shows the terrain of Mars fantastically well.\n\nWhen you build buildings little roads crawl across the map to connect your main hub to these new structures. However, the star attraction is how the game simulates the AI working on the layout of her domain. When you place a building blue, almost circuit-like, lines emanate from surrounding structures to find the best route for the roads that will spread across the Martian landscape. This means that roads will follow the terrain in a way that makes for the most efficient transport of resources. It really is quite beautiful.\n\nThe terrain is mapped by the use of contour lines and shading of the map to denote height and depth of land. When panning the map you can see the craters and hills of Mars in lovely detail. Zooming around further you can find the areas that will clearly become the future seas of Mars. Zooming in to Olympus Mons is great. I believe I saw the bird dream (music reference). \n\n[u]The UI[/u]\n\nWhen I first watched this game on You Tube about a week ago (it has been on my wishlist for ages though) the poster of the video said that the UI could do with more tooltips. Maybe that has been rectified but I have no major issues with the UI. It has a lovely technical style to it, and is crisp and well laid out. If I had one suggestion to make to the developers then I would ask for more detail in the tool tips when the resources are hovered over. I would like a detailed list for where resources are needed. Currently you only have a text outline of how much of a resource is produced and how much is needed.\n\nTaking inspiration from a game like Cities: Skylines, it would be great if the game had a map mode that showed resource production sites and lines on the road grid that show where that resource is going. It is not always fully evident how much of a resource is at each structure and where that resource is needed. You need to learn the resources to make things simpler. There are also no mouseovers of what the resources are on the building panel; just the icons. Once you learn those icons things are great and you will build at liberty.\n\nReally, though, the game just flows on regardless. The resource bar shows clearly how many resources you have and you can see where bottlenecks are. It could just do with some fleshing out and more tools for the user. Per Aspera is far from the only game where a user might request a few more quality of life tools and the game doesn\u2019t suffer horrendously for a few wants, so this is not a damning of the work of Tl\u00f6n Industries. It is just suggestions.\n\nI do like the map modes that are present in the game. They are lovely overlays that show such things as your traffic network, maintenance range and resources.\n\nMy issues are minor really though.\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nWhat I have outlined so far is just the basics of the game really. There seems to be so much more to the game and I will let anyone that is already interested explore the game for themselves. The music is an example of this. It is both futuristic and ambient. I found myself tapping my foot when the music centred around human colonists started playing.\n\nI have currently put seven hours in to Per Aspera and I have enjoyed every second. I am finding the going easy currently, and I am playing on the hardest difficulty. I restarted once when I overbuilt and ran out of starting electronics, but if you follow the missions (that the game calls directives) then you shouldn\u2019t fall in to the same trap as me. I tend to push colony sims often because I have played so very many of them. I can see where the game will become more of a challenge and how things will fail if you are not organised and prepared for humans.\n\nThere is also a random element regarding how many resource patches you find. I like a degree of randomness to the game, and in Per Aspera it is not over-burdening or game damaging.\n\nTo finish I will say I really love the story element regarding AMI so far. I love the way AMI poses her thoughts and how the game lets you decide her answers to the questions she poses to herself or those posed by the humans in the game. I won\u2019t spoil anything but suffice it to say the story element is wonderfully incorporated in to the game.\n\nAfter seven hours I just find myself wishing that nominations for the Steam Awards for this year were not finished. Per Aspera is an outstanding little game and easily deserves to be recognised in 2020. I am very much going to enjoy exploring further my terraforming mission of Mars.\n\nNow back to looking after my little humans. AMI out.\n\n[i]Yes, what I am saying is go get this game. If you have any love of Mars centred games, colony builders and science fiction then getting Per Aspera is a no-brainer. A+[/i]\n\n\n\n",

  "review": "TLWR: I realize the rest of the review is more like a rant about slightly spoilery things, so here's a bit of actual \"buyer's advice\" sort of review.\n\nThe game, from its visuals, its promotional art, and various screen caps, will have you believe that it is a game with serious themes, hard science and various base management, expansion and exploration elements.\n\nIt's not really.\n\nThe theme is pretty serious and I do enjoy it, but you realize some time into the game that the theme is not the one you might have been expecting.\n\nThe science is there, but in name only. A lot of things don't make sense and breaks your suspension of disbelief if you came in looking forward to some proper conservation of energy and matter.\n\nThe management... if you like Factorio and Mindustry and such games, do [i]not[/i] buy this game. It will hook you for the first handful hours, and then frustrate you to death with the whole array of missing fine tuning and controls that the game was kind enough to dumb away from you.\n\nThe game also violates a line I firmly believe in, even though it might not be a majority opinion. [i]A game should not punish the player for a mistake they are not warned about[/i]. As is, you have a whole lot of ways to back your development into an unescapable corner. Maybe this game wants to be Civilization, in which even a long, failed game still feels plenty rewarding. But this game most assuredly can't be replayed the same way Civ can.\n\nOh, great voice acting though.\n\n[spoiler]\nThe game has promises, and if implemented well, I think few things can surpass the sense of accomplishment of terraforming an entire planet. That said, I will not be returning to play this game until these points are more or less addressed:\n\n* Water. This will not be the first nor the last post to point out how absurd it is that the only way to obtain water is from solid water deposits, and you can no loner do so when said deposit is buried under [i]liquid water which is just water[/i], welp. I guess your colonists might as well just die of thirst.\n* Water. The incredibly idiot colonists, despite all the training and scientific prowess, does not know how to do water recycling. Water that is retrieved from the planet surface is then just... discarded? Ever heard of this lovely thing called \"conservation of matter\"? I didn't bring in new colonists, the atmosphere didn't get more steam in it, and they sure as hell ain't watering any plants, so [i]where did the water go[/i]?\n* Water. OK so the colonists just pees into some hole in their colonies and seal them up, like [i]any good space explorers would[/i]. Hopefully [i]some[/i] of them at some point in school heard of some kinds of methods to clean that water, and even if they have no internet on Mars because the WiFi is bad, and forgot to bring wikipedia on a harddrive, hey, with all their big brains to research hyperloop and shit, maybe invent water filtering again?\n* Chemicals. For what reason are these things so prominently located in flooded zones?\n* AI. For attempting to make a game about managing resources and economy, the sophistication of resource routing and management doesn't remotely compare to Mindustry.\n* Player Education. It is one thing to refuse to hand-hold the players, which I do applaud the game for. It is another to let the players shoot themselves in the foot with the shiny new technology the just unlocked, only to realize that 10 hours later the thing they built 9 hours ago will devastate their whole food income by flooding the largest chemical source on the planet. And don't you [i]dare[/i] suggest one just start over, unless they can procedurally regenerate a brand new but still accurate-to-real-life Mars? This is something other players have repeatedly mentioned as well -- doing something that is unlocked very early in the game prevents you from doing something seemingly forever. One may argue that this is to impress upon the player that you only get one go at terraforming and how fragile the natural order is, to which my reply is, then don't bother making it a game to begin with.\n* Bad routing. Crops up occasionally with stupid bendy and self-intersecting pathing. No way to force a localized redirect.\n* UX. Why are all the other space port projects sane but the immigration project auto-repeating? Before you know it you have more colonists than your chemical plants can handle, and I don't know about others, I like to think of myself as a lawful player who does not enjoy the idea of sending colonists on a year journey from and then back to Earth because something as simply communicated as \"wait we are not at the food production level to take y'all yet.\"\n* Food. I am not convinced the colonists would happily live on entirely manufactured food. The entire \"green house based food growing\" thing should be feasible as soon as they can land. It's one thing to make the entirety of Mars arable, but a whole other to allow a bunch of scientists to grow stuff in a green house and sustain themselves, if only partially. Like, obviously you are heating the place and there's sun light. I get you need specialized plants to inhabit low O2 Mars, but in the contained colonies? Let them grow shit, and use their poop to recycle the chemicals back into food!\n* UX. Cannot split drone groups. Merging sometimes bug out.\n* UX. The resource increase/decrease icon just shows whether a resource has increased or decreased [i]from a previous number[/i]. That is NOT helpful. This being a resource-management-heavy, show that \"demand > supply\" status prominently! Especially when not all resources are equally elastic in demand!\n* Lack of things to research. Terraforming a planet should have so, [i]so[/i] many sciency things you could research! Here are some free (I hereby declare the following as Public Domain) ideas:\n  - Raw stats upgrades, like multi-carry workers, individually improvable mining efficiencies\n  - Water recycling for the wasteful colonists\n  - Static Defense that is not tied to drones\n  - Scanner targeting module\n  - Assault Drone hunter mode\n  - Ways to persuade colonists to stay -- entertainment and such. There obviously is a happiness system, so let us play with it!\n  - Green House agriculture.\n  - Green House animal husbandry.\n  - Still find it weird that *all* transports must be ground based. Allow transportation between space ports? Like, Hyperloop is cool and all, but why go through underground when there's literally all that low-density not-air above you, and the 1/3rd Earth gravity?\n  - Actually screw Hyperloop, just upgrade to air based transport all together. It's one thing to rely on rovers when you are scouting out the place, but if you are developing an industry, then be real about it.\n  - Steam energy generation. You have carbon and water, no? This will add some dimension to the whole \"material to energy\" conversion layer that you get to challenge players on.\n  - Specialized material conversion, e.g. use steel and carbon as consumable drill bits for deep drilling for chemical or something like that.\n  - Power network separation. Allow separating parts of your base's power network and allow redundancy and fail-safe. Honestly this shouldn't even require researching.\n  - Honestly rewrite the tech tree. It seems entirely bizarre and prevents suspension of disbelief that humanity is capable of sending people to Mars but for some reason don't allow them to bring in their super USB drives how to build a fission reactor.\n  - Pipes and pumps.\n  - More things orbital. If you can put up polar mirrors you can put up geostationary lasers. The drones already use them, and it's established there's not really an atmosphere to speak of yet.\n\nI had, admittedly, a good bit of fun playing this from 12AM to 4AM, but the fact that I can sit down after the session to write all of this from 4AM to 5AM is attestment to the state the game is in.\n[/spoiler]",

There's this shoehorned combat mechanic, which must have been implemented because the devs were afraid that terraforming Mars wasn't challenging enough.

After the halfway mark, when you have a few bases across the planet, the framerate tanks horribly. What started as a smooth 100+ FPS strategy game, becomes a literal slideshow when you enter the endgame of actually terraforming the planet. You would think, if this was actually the point of the game, they would optimize the engine to ensure consistent performance throughout.\n\n2.a. If should also be mentioned that both my CPU and GPU were rarely taxed above 40% while the game was running, which is surprising to see when I encountered such low framerates and constant hitches and freezes. It's apparent the game needs a lot of work.",

  "review": "I would like to give a neutral review. I really enjoyed the game but for its current state I cannot give it a positive review. It really needs A LOT of improvement and optimisation. I finished my first game on the highest difficult. The story was really fun although the ending is bit weird. You get asked for two options/missions and then the credits roll?\n\nBecause the discussion page is overloaded right now I\u2019ll post my recommendations here and hope one of the devs will pick it up. I will keep this review updated for future patches. \n\n1.\tMore workers per hub + better worker optimization. In the end when I had 300 workers it still did not solve the supply and demand. I had to reset a lot of buildings to get resources delivered.  I think making multiple workers per hub possible will improve congestion. \n2.\tResources. For such a big planet some resource do get really scarce. And I\u2019ve seen multiple reports on the discussions by other people. Maybe adding like end game functions where you can have some sort infinite supply? Like water, what\u2019s the point of creating oceans and lakes when u can\u2019t use the water and keep relying on ice? Another possibility would be ocean mining and exploration. A lot gets lost in the process of terraforming. \n3.\tStorage and logistics. The storage centres as is don\u2019t work properly. Drones deliver resources but when demand is getting high the will not haul it from the same centres. The same can be applied to the overall logistics. A lot of resources get stuck in one place. Even when I had a worldwide hyperloop network, workers sometimes still travelled basic routes to deliver goods.\n\nSome quality of life improvements would be:\n4.\tMore personal key bindings + options;\n5.\tIn late game adding notifications when a project is finished in orbit would really help;\n6.\tWays of halving your combat drones swarm (if there is one let me know please);\n7.\tIn the structure tab options to select and deselect all or specific groups;\n8.\tMaybe automatic road upgrades. It gets really micro and tedious if you have a big base.",

Potential spoilers in review, though your game will likely break too, so I can't really spoil what can't be experienced.\n\nToo many bugs - some game breaking to boot! The story that is supposedly a big selling point is rather dry and keeps throwing dialogue out of order. Additionally, my campaign broke and is stuck at 'eliminate enemies in sa-1, while the only thing there is the ocean.\n\nBad game design choices - finite resources and maintenance, limited power building reach, 'worker drones' dying while we have maintenance drones, as well as worker drones being logistics as well as builder bots, boring research tree that doesn't actually unlock sustainability, colonists being the research source FOR AN AI!!! (hello? Wonderful opportunity to make 'cpu blocks' on the surface, have them require power and produce research), food being made from chemicals and water, water only being available in the form of ice, while half the planet is ocean, scientifically incorrect atmospheric requirements, pointless combat that serves only as a story gimmick but doesn't feel good and isn't well explained, completely random resource generation, with over half spawning in eventually unreachable places... I'd write more, but that would be putting in more effort than the game designer.\n\nTedium - The game has a speed up option, which I kept at 16x all the time. I wish there was a 128x option to be honest. The game has 3 hours worth of content stretched into 12 with time gating. Campaigns can also be literally unfinishable due to you running out of water. Literally. You can smash an ice asteroid into the planet, you can make oceans appear out of nothing - water level is based purely on temperature, not on actually extracting underground water or smashing ice comets into mars - but you can run out of water, because the colonists apparently send their excrement to space and only eat ice and chemical food.\n\nThe music is boring, best turned off after 30 minutes.\n\nThe UI is stylish and thematic, but poorly explained and lacks many features one would expect in a logistics/management game.\n\nThe only redeeming feature is that the art overall is very nice.\n\nThe voice acting is also good, but I honestly couldn't give a rat's ass who you hired to do your voice acting. It's not a selling point in gaming, especially in niche games such as this. \n\n",

Trying to get alot of items to spaceports/elevators seems to get hundereds of items stuck in just one building. But quickly turning these ports off and on resets the item requests and gets stuff moving again.\nSpeaking about the fps it started out really good but dropped below 20 fps several times nearing the end.

However, you can't really enjoy the story currently due to wonky decision tree structure where the story and Voice-Overs describe choices you *did not* choose to make, and there's a variety of Voice-Over continuity problems where the story mentions events that already happened as being in the future or as simply not having been discovered/known about yet.\n\nIt plays and feels like an early access game, though I look forward to patches and hopefully mods to make this game shine and turn this review to a positive.",

There's a tech tree system which you might expect would give you the capabilities to reuse and recycle - but all you get is new stuff to waste your finite ressources on, and upgrades to your mines and factories that allow you to use up your finite ressources even faster - yay!\n\nA few hours into the game (if RNGesus was kind to you and you could actually progress this far without your supply chain collapsing), you'll stumble upon a comically simple and annoying combat system that requires you to micromanage the hell out of an increasingly unrulingly large colony. You aren't properly notified of current issues and destroyed buildings don't automatically repair - meaning that if you don't frequently scan your entire colony for any broken buildings and immediately fix them, you'll rapidly hit a death spiral you can't get out of.

The research tree is rather dull, with only the hyperloop being an actual game changer. Running out of minerals and resources is frustrating as you have to make longer and longer \"tentacles\" of droid bases into the unknown for just one or two resource nodes. \n\nI spent most of the time playing at maximum speed, and it still felt like the game was absolutely crawling.

  "review": "[ENG/ESP] Good game, buy it. Enjoy this different point of view!\n\nThe amount of bad reviews this game has is absurd, this game is not \"Surviving Mars\" and it is fine. The dynamics of \"Per Aspera\" is different from other games of this genre and fulfills the objective of not leaving the game in the background.\n\nThe construction is dynamic, it is automatic but at the same time it is not. You have to necessarily expand and the fact that resources are limited forces you to restructure your systems from time to time, which means that you cannot just leave the game there and I don't know, start reading a book (Which I can do for a while but brought me a couple of consequences). By the way, the road improvement system is not bad, improve where you see more traffic and continue checking other sites.\n\nTerraforming objectives are slow at some point and may seem tedious, but the fact that you have to be very aware of your systems infrastructure means that the objectives are met without even noticing (in a good way).\n\nThe combat system is clearly inspired by more primitive game systems, which is not bad when there are several systems to optimize or create.\n\nThe research branch is clearly simple, but simplicity loses importance when the game is seen from the narrative and not so much from the normal parameters of a construction game. This game puts certain sites to investigate, but the objective of these is not primarily objective, but rather narrative!\n\nPersonally I feel that \"Per Aspera\" aims to create a plot that encourages the player to immerse themselves in the story while promoting thinking and re-thinking certain thoughts about I don't know, in the beginning it made me think about personal identity, then on the reasons and consequences of human expansion, etc. The idea of \u200b\u200bimagining an AI in the style that the game proposes is interesting.\n\nAt this point, the difference with other games is clear. \"Surviving Mars\" does not force you in the same way to expand since the dynamics is more \"It grows slowly but surely because you're going to screw it up\" and \"Per Aspera\" is more \"GROW, GROW MORE REPEATING AN ALGORITHM, but don't forget your base because you're going to screw it up. \"\n\n\nIn conclusion, the game is good and enjoyable for me when it is appreciated from the narrative and the personal approach while you manage your system and expansion and WHY AM I NOT PRODUCING FOOD ?! (Tysm for reading me :) )\n\n\n----------------------------\n\nEs absurda la cantidad de malas rese\u00f1as que este juego posee, este juego no es \"Surviving Mars\" y est\u00e1 bien.  La din\u00e1mica de \"Per Aspera\" es diferente a otros juegos de este genero y cumple con el objetivo de que no dejes el juego en segundo plano. \n\nLa construcci\u00f3n es din\u00e1mica, es automatica pero a la vez no lo es. Tienes que expandirte necesariamente y el hecho de que los recursos sean limitados te fuerza reestructurar tus sistemas cada cierto tiempo, lo cual hace que no puedas simplemente dejar el juego ah\u00ed y no s\u00e9, ponerse a leer un libro (Cosa que logre durante un tiempo pero me trajo un par de consecuencias). Por cierto, el sistema de mejora de caminos no est\u00e1 mal, mejora donde veas mayor circulaci\u00f3n y continua chequeando otros sitios.\n\nLos objetivos de terraformaci\u00f3n son lentos en cierto punto y pueden parecer tediosos, pero el hecho de que tengas que estar bastante pendiente de la infraestructura de tus sistemas logra que los objetivos se vayan cumpliendo sin siquiera notarlo (en el buen sentido).\n\nEl sistema de combate est\u00e1 claramente inspirado en sistemas de juegos mas primitivos, lo cual no est\u00e1 mal cuando hay varios sistemas que optimizar o crear.\n\nLa rama de investigaci\u00f3n es simple claramente, pero la simplicidad pierde importancia cuando se aprecia el juego desde la narrativa y no tanto desde los parametros normales de un juego de construcci\u00f3n. Este juego pone ciertos sitios para invesitgar, pero el objetivos de estos no es principalmente objetivo, sino que es narrativo!\n\nPersonalmente siento que \"Per Aspera\" apunta a crear una trama que insita al jugador a sumergirse en la historia a la vez que promueve el pensar y re-pensar ciertos pensamientos sobre no s\u00e9, en el principio me hizo pensar sobre la identidad personal, luego sobre los motivos y consecuencias de la expanci\u00f3n humana, etc. La idea de imaginar una IA en el estilo que el juego propone es interesante.\n\nEn este punto, queda clara la diferencia con otros juegos. \"Surviving Mars\" no te fuerza de la misma manera a expandirte puesto que la dinamica es mas \"Crece lento pero seguro porque la vas a cagar\" y \"Per Aspera\" es mas \"CRECE, CRECE MAS REPITIENDO UN ALGORITMO, pero no olvides tu base porque la vas a cagar\".\n\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, el juego me resulta bueno y agradable cuando es apreciado desde la narrativa y el planteamiento personal a la vez que administras tu sistema y expansi\u00f3n y PORQUE NO ESTOY PRODUCIENDO COMIDA?! (Tysm por leerme :) )\n\n",

  "review": "I'll probably put away this game until it's patched a couple of times, and revisit it next year, maybe... Right now the game is very rough around the edges, and it shows some unconventional UI choices, compared to other strategy games and traditional gaming logic:\n\u2022 I played for 20 hours and didn't realize that you can actually control assault drones - I was sure that they are stationary around their hive towers...\n\u2022 I played for 10 hours thinking that setting up additional bases is bugged, because the initial base structure doesn't have enough resources (5 aluminium) to build the initial aluminium mine (6 aluminium) after you've researched \"Mines II\" - the tiny button to build Level 1 mine that cost 2 aluminium was completely lost in the UI...\n\nThe idea that renewable resources like water, carbon, iron, silicon, aluminium \"run out\" is an understandable game mechanic, but it feels absurd sometimes:\n\u2022 You terraform Mars, and get a big ocean of water right next to your base, but your base runs out of water because all your \"water nodes\" were axhausted...\n\u2022 You build biodomes, but they can't produce food for some reason...\n\u2022 Runaway photosynthesis raising O2 above 50% is also unrealistic - there are compensation points between light intensity, O2 concentration and CO2 concentration (partial pressure) - normal photosynthesis is unable to raise O2 concentration above 35-40% at high CO2 concentration because at that level respiration becomes higher than photosynthesis... For example, at normal Earth CO2 level of 400ppm plants can only raise O2 to about 27%...\n\u2022 You build drones out of aluminium, silicon and iron - they break down eventually - and the resourced are entirely removed from the world... It's far future, we are advanced enough to build interplanetary starships, terraform planets, and develop strong AI, but we, apparently, don't have basic element recycling technology... Yet, when you deconstruct buildings you do recycle some resources... Drones are a constant sink for a lot of renewable resources, and they act like a countdown timer for your colony...\n\nAnd most importantly, by trying to not break the fourth wall with tutorials and gameplay hints, the game skips explanation of some of the most obscure, but very much crucial controls...\n\nI'll wait for a couple gameplay patches, then I'll try again... The story is cool...",

All I found is that the campaign story is essentially Chinese propaganda (you're forced to side with the commies and betray the ISA (USA), or destroy everything you built) and the end game does not make for a colony builder, which I expected this game to be. There is water everywhere (you terraformed after all) but you can't harvest enough water to build a meaningful population.\n\nI'd be more forgiving if this game was in early access, but it's not.\n\nMy two biggest issues, that resulted in no recommendation:\n\n1: Autosave intervals are ridiculous. 5 years before the first one? And it's not an option!? What year is this?\n\n2: Structure caps. This is not a real colony builder if the game tells you that you can't build more structures for no arbitrary reason. I'd understand if it was based on resources, but its not. It's purely a sorry excuse for a rushed mechanic to hinder progress, so the game feels longer. Huge mistake for any colony builder.",

  "review": "So I bought this game around 4PM, expecting more or less another generic albeit nice looking colony game.  7 1/2 hours later....MY GOD.  The only reason I quit was because the FPS dipped so freaking low it was borderline unplayable.  Max human pop, covered like half the planet in buildings, game just chugs.  But the STORY.  Sweet Jesus.  It starts out so generic, while still mildly interesting in a way, a nice spin on colony building, and then balloons up into one of the COOLEST stories I've ever seen, especially in a builder game!  Normally I stick to skirmish mode for games like this, but I cannot recommend the campaign enough!\n\nLike I mentioned though, this game is too big for its britches.  By the time I unlocked 4 zones, my game went from 144FPS to 50FPS.  By the time I populated most of that real estate with buildings and humans, I was down to 5-10FPS, and no amount of zooming in or out would speed it up.  I'd like to think I have a fairly beefy computer, but it couldn't handle the the last quarter of the game very well.\n\nAlso, resources start to run out faster and faster the more you research, as your mine become more economical.  The mining nodes don't really hold all that many resources, several of the resources are scarce (Why the HELL did I have such a hard time finding Iron when Mars is COVERED in it?) so combining the efficient mining and small quantities, you will find yourself scouring for more.\n\nI also don't like how road upgrades work.  By the time I researched even the first one, I had literally hundreds of roads, all of which have to be manually upgraded, AND if the road is shifted for whatever reason (say, putting a building on it, or in range for it to redraw), you lose the upgrade.  When you upgrade roads, it should automatically make all your roads from then on that type of road.  I ended up just never using them and skipped right to Hyperloops, which are absolute resource hogs, but completely worth it once your colony gets 1,000+km wide.  \n\nOverall, in its current state as of 12/04/20, this game is a solid 9/10 from me.  I can only hope that future patches iron out all of the bugs and inconsistencies in the game, minor though they may be.",

Most of it is literally just waiting for 1 worker to move around. The campaign somewhat helps build you towards a direction, but I ended up abandoning it because of how annoying it became (enemies while trying to fix your maintenance infrastructure, structures randomly exploding is not fun.) In sandbox, resource management is terrible. They give you a somewhat decent starting point in the campaign, but in sandbox, it's incredibly difficult to choose a starting point that actually gives you enough resources to continue the game. \n\nThis games biggest flaw is resource management, there is virtually no options for it beyond prioritising a single structure. Everything in this game looks pretty and well managed, but the core gameplay grinds to a halt because of bad truck AI randomly picking things to do.  A bad example is aluminum - it's necessary for everything, but incredibly rare beyond the resource patches. You can quite literally just lose the game because you cannot find enough of it. \n\nIn order to expand to a certain area, instead of just, y'know, building a road, you have to build a long line of resource intensive buildings, usually power buildings because you have to connect power this way. It's infuriating being unable to build a mine because you can't build the 900 solar panels to get to it!\n\nToo much of this game is waiting, I hope they fix it eventually, but for now, for the price they are asking, I cannot recommend this in this state.",

It's funny the first time around but when it keeps happening over and over again it gets old.\n\nManaging your AI driven empire is basically a boring mini-game where you look at production charts and if the blue line is less than the red line you build more stuff.\nThere's no real challenge here. You very quickly figure out how to build things somewhat efficiently and it just gets repetitive.\nEventually (about eight hours longer than it should take) you get to the late game where you're required to produce an absolutely insane amount of stuff to progress the story. Seriously, waiting for 3+ hours for the next story event to fire is a tad boring.\n\nThings might go a bit faster if the game would just f**king work for once. The bots just get stuck, production lines halt as the bots can't manage to bring the missing 1 item to the job. Turning production buildings off and on again fixes it but only for a moment.\n\nThere's very limited strategy involved with expansion. You look for the resource you lack and then daisy-chain your buildings towards a high density zone of said resource. There's no guarantee you'll get enough resources at the zone either so your plans are basically wishes.\n\nSince you're not allowed to build on an incline you get this wonderfully magical and truly majestic mini-game of \"find that pixel\". It has to be juuuust right. It's infuriating and serves no purpose other than to aggravate the player.\n\nIf you do find yourself looking for a resource and you've already tapped the high density zones you get to the second best minigame. As there are no helpers put into the game for you to find a resource node on the planet, you will spend a good few minutes scrolling around the map trying to spot the right resource icon, which all look very alike too. If I wanted a game like this I'd buy a f**king where's waldo book!\n\nThe longer you play the more the performance tanks and the more bugs you'll run into; Dialogue audio is either wrong or doesn't play at all; bots don't deliver goods; clicking on the building list button takes a whopping minute for it to open; saving and loading after crashing deimos (mars' moon) into mars, it's back in orbit.\n\nI can see that there was an attempt. Too bad it failed just as badly as the previous colonization attempts portrayed in the game.\n\nThe only reason I kept playing as long as I did was the story, it's pretty good.",

  "review": "Overall, I think this is a good game that has the potential to be a great game, with the right bug fixing, balancing, and some more feature adding. What I think a lot of these reviews (Mixed at the time of writing this) are forgetting, is that this game was JUST released. This is brand new, and aside from a day0 patch, this game has not had any balancing or fixing done. Most of the issues people are complaining about have nothing to do with the core of the game, the concepts, barely even the mechanics. Most of the issues are just balancing issues, random bugs, or the need for some UX improvements; all things that can and will happen over time to make this game better and better.\n\nThe core gameplay and mechanics, as well as story, have been really interesting and fun so far. I sunk hours into playing this game when I picked it up, and I will continue to do so.\n\nThe good:\n- Story is honestly really compelling. You are an advanced AI who's job is to extract resources from Mars to build factories, colonies, and eventually, terraform mars into a planet with water, and atmosphere, oxygen, and plantlife. I have already had a lot of fun expanding and slowly colonizing and terraforming Mars.\n\nThe bad (things that need fixed)\n- The balancing of resources can be incredibly difficult, both in very early game (not having nodes around you, having to set game to 16x speed just to wait long enough for required resources to be produced) and in the late game. All resources on the planet have a limit of about 500. This goes incredibly fast, and while I understand that the game developers want you to continuously explore the world for new resources to harvest, this limit is far too low. When you mix the forced need to expand very far out, with the late-game enemies spawning randomly to attack things, this becomes a huge problem, less of a challenge and more of a problematic game design, because you have to build support structures, repair structures, power structures, roads, and defensive structures or else the enemy will just destroy everything.",

Unfortunately you have to waste a fair bit of time before the game falls apart.",

  "review": "It sucks to not recommend this game. So much of the game is interesting, and very well made. However the designers decided that 'difficulty' means to just absolutely screw over the player with no ability to recover. There is zero way to recover from anything in this game if you don't already know exactly what will come and exactly when it will come. \n\nAlien invasions are the perfect example of how incompetent the design is. Aliens are faster than you, and can bypass your drones without activating them. They can fly THROUGH your drones and they wont do anything. They make no sound, no visual indication, no one says \"hey we're being attacked' nothing. Your defenses don't do anything if you dont micro manage them, and there's borderline no way to know you're being attacked if you're not constantly looking for it. On top of which, these things attack your drones, power, and facilities. They attack extremely frequently, in some cases only SECONDS after the previous attack. There is no way to recover in such an insanely short time, and these attacks will completely end an entire campaign of  upwards of 5 hours. \n\nImagine sitting and micromanaging an entire campaign every second for 5 hours. Then imagine getting fucked over so hard that you literally can't do anything to recover or even stop it for the high crime of not already knowing every event of the game.",

  "review": "Updated Review 06th December 2020 :\n\nI initially provided a positive review for the title, unfortunately the current state of the game requires that I leave a negative review highlighting the issues i'm seeing : \n\n1) Road construction AI : There needs to be a way to control how roads are built to create a more linear transport network. See point 2\n\n2) Worker transport AI : As a result of the bugs with the road network the drones will commonly go into a death loop, getting perpetually stuck between two buildings. Drones are the lifeblood of yr planetary network, there inefficiency, coupled with long construction times results in most of your production buildings grinding to a halt due to full storage capacity\n\n3) Despite well placed worker hubs and storage depots, the workers will dump random resources at production buildings. \n\n4) No way to store resources for an emergency or specific future project. \n\n5) Maintenance Hubs : The drones are consumed upon doing the repair works. This is a redundant game design choice. Why would a sentient advanced machine produce expensive drones that comsume themselves? Rather use resources that create nanites that the repairs drones consume. we can then have a supply of nanites close at hand to supply these hubs.. Or build this into the Hubs functionality. \n\n6) Resource pocket quanities. The recent update increased the spawn rate but there will need to be a buff to overall resource quantities per node. \n\n7) In general the game is not forthcoming with info letting you know when you have issues with production.\n\nSummary : The AI is the worst part of this game right now and as the player taking control of a sentient AI machine, you cant fall in love with the system because you constantly faced with the glaring errors of the drone AI network. \n\nThere needs to be far more control for yr drones. I see no other way than to allow the player to create their own road networks so the drones are forced into set paths to achieve efficient logistics systems.",

  "review": "TL;DR - Game feels unpolished and like an early-access game the devs played so much that they might be the only people who understand the precise build order you need to succeed. Want to experiment? You don't get to, because unless you play the way the devs intended, you lose. And you can't go back to a previous save , previous month, previous year and try again because of REASONS.\n\nI'll keep playing it and give it another shot, but mindlessly expanding, running out of resources, and poor robot/worker optimization is killing the game and my enjoyment right now. I've played for 6 hours so far. That's enough for 3 games up until meteor swarm + alien invasion = game over.\n\nDo I need to expand? Do I need to NOT expand? What do these symbols mean? \n\nMy eyes are strained from searching on the surface of mars for a single building I put down at the start of the game that I need to upgrade because I finally was able to research the technology. But can I find it? No, because it looks EXACTLY like the other 10,000 buildings I have on the surface. Is there an easy way to find the building I need? Some sort of 'Here are your buildings' menu?? Not that I can tell. But again, you wouldn't know because the game doesn't tell you anything.\n\nThe visual interface is cluttered and messy and it's very hard actually figure out what;s going on, let alone get ahead of any problems that occur.\n\nThere is no tutorial, and the game WILL take multiple plays through in order to make any sense.\n\nI want to like the game, but as it stands right now, I cannot recommend it.\n\nEdit: I am hopeful the developers are taking steps in the right direction. \nAs of 2020/12/11 consider this: This is an EARLY ACCESS TITLE. TREAT IT AS SUCH, instead of a NEGATIVE.\nGive it a month or two, see the progress that has been made, and then decide.",

  "review": "Very interesting game. However there are a couple of features I wish that were in it.\n\n1. A 1-10 or even 1-5 prioritisation system that affects all buildings on the map based on what they make. (E.g Set Electronics factories to 5 when you run low on them.) at the moment you are left to switch all factories on or off prioritisation which brings much headache.\n\n2. Workers should prioritise upgrade orders. I have issued a command to upgrade some mines and factories and come back a while later to find them still not upgraded and bottle necking my production line. Prioritising them works but then I have to turn it off again after it is done, which is just more tedium.\n\n3. Campaign mission dialogue can be out of order. A person will reference a previous topic that you havn't had yet and then the dialogue about that topic happens after. I think this happens because dialogue is tied to progression only and not to other pieces of dialogue so you do something out of the intended order and it will mess up the dialogue.\n\nOther than that I am having a wonderful time. The devs seem to care and are working hard on patching many of the issues that are occurring.",

  "review": "This game is right up my alley in terms of genre.  I love space sim/colony/builder/survival type games.  I started playing the game yesterday and all of a sudden it was 3am... this is exactly the effect a decent game should have on me.  I love how the tutorial is woven into the campaign story, and everything about this game is unobtrusive.  The voice acting is good and not over the top or cheesy like you get from a lot of games, it's all very professional sounding.  The background music is good, and I say good because I didnt even notice the game HAD background music until about 4 hours into play.  That's what I like... not having to immediately go into settings and adjust audio volumes.  I also really LOVE playing as the perspective of the AI.  I'm excited to see how my choices affect my game later down the road.  I'm hoping HOPING that this can be a sort of Black & White type thing where I can be a benevolent AI, or I can be an evil domineering AI overlord.\n\nThe game mechanics are not too complicated if you've played games like this before.  There is no \"hand holding teach you to move, shove info down your throat\" type tutorial, and that's OK because the game is simple enough to figure out on your own.  The UI is not busy and in my opinion is well organized.  I can already see that this is going to be a game that winds up with hundreds of hours of gameplay.\n\nTo the devs, great job!\n\nFeature requests:\n-Add a technology to maybe increase the worker drones per worker hub from one to two.  Late game and I'm having some load issues despite cramming in new hubs everywhere.  This load issue is even after I rebuilt half my base to keep resource chains in close proximity in an effort to be efficient.\n-Some of the AI \"reflections\" seem a bit repetitive.  I was already building up atmospheric pressure and was almost at 300mb and the AI was STILL rambling on about the microsuns.\n-I like talking to Houston and the Commander.  Can maybe add in a feature where I could initiate communications with them at will instead of them just randomly calling me only when there's some event?\n-Allow me to set the transfer colonist task at the spaceport to auto-expire instead of having to sit and stare at the progress bar waiting for it to get back on Earth and only then can you cancel it.",

Your self-awareness as an artificial intelligence is a constant theme as you make observations of the red planet.\n\nYour workers are actually smart, too.\n\nLow on power? Your workers will automatically prioritize building that solar array.\n\nNeed a building finished asap? You won't need to crush down or turn off another construction project, your workers will pull resources away from that building to put in the designated priority. Some very welcome features, to be sure, and adds a lot of satisfaction to the game play.\n\nCertainly a gem, even among the popular genre of Martian colony builders.
