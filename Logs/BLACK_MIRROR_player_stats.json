The story its fantastic and kind of closure of the series (series of games). The graphics are very good. Unfortnally I've beat it in 15hrs - would be better a 30hrs content.\nBut lets by honest: the camera its bloody hell - but not to a point that you cant play - its just annoying.\nI hope the they launch a 5th sequence - or second, considering this one as a hole new thing.",

Again as one of cursed Gordons investigating what happened in the Black Mirror castle.\nGraphics is very nice.\nI played whole game on Steam controller with no issue.\nThere are some minor bugs. I used auto-save once. Achievements are not working in Linux version.\nI wish it to be longer and walking more world oriented while platforming.",

It's quite short, the world scenes are not very big either, it's got clunky walking mechanics and a horrible camera, but it was of no consequence to me.

  "review": "It's a game you have to give the chance and time till it gets good or better, depending on how you like it. It was interesting to see how the horror movie remaster trend style was translated into a game. Personally, I've seen all of it before and it's probably not worth your time. - TLDR\n\nThis is like every modern horror movie and remakes of old. If you watch a ton of horror movies you'll understand.\nAt the same time it's all of them. I could easily sit here and write down a dozen of horror remakes this takes atmosphere, scenes and plot elements from.\nThe general difference, to give you an idea, between this and the original is close to that of Nightmare on Elm Street and it's 2010 remake. So the wires inside this mannequin would be the same, as for the mannequin itself...\n\nThing is the old Mirrors were horror stylised adventure games, there was nothing scary about them. They try to make it horror here.\nA small cast of characters, confined in *insert spoopy place*, spoopy things start happening, secrets, conspiracies, creepy locals seem to know wtf is up but don't tell you. You know where I'm headed with this.\n\nThe structure of the plot is reminiscent of Black Mirror I and some scenes, particularly the beginning ones are the same, although the context differs. \n\nThe [b]fanservice[/b] is admirable. There's not much of it but there are some very iconic things. \nSuch as: protagonist sometimes making sarcastic remarks thinking to himself whilst talking to somebody.\nA familiar sound queue will play at one point in the game.\nCollecting torn photo pieces. Eventually even getting to do the jigsaw! Although that would be putting together a torn burned note not a picture. Photo pieces just unlock 3 extra jigsaws for you to do from the main menu but those are very easy and frankly bad.\n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n\nAll characters in the original were friendly and welcoming, even the baddies. \"Imma act like a nice old lady givin out candy but really, I'm plottin\".\nHere it's a complete 180 and everyone is a creepy ars3hole, \"Straight up, I hate the sole fact that you exist and I'll scream: you gon die B!TCH!! to your face\" kinda like in \"Cabin in the Woods\".\n\nThe main character is an average Joe with a sense of style.\nInept Samuel from the original or dysfunctional, silly Darren from part 2 and 3 are much better protagonists imho but it works for the vibe they went for in this one.\n\nYou get a supporting character who follows you for the better part of the game, pretty cool.\n\n[b]Playability[/b]\n\nIt plays like a localised telltale game not a point&click. \n\nSoundtrack being this game's strongest suit suddenly just stopped for me (near the start of the game so idk if it was intentional or not) and wandering around the corridors with occasional typical old house noises wasn't too exciting. Very powerful tunes at the times where music did reappear.\n\nOriginals had beautiful gothic pre-rendered environments. - This time the game takes place entirely within the manor. \nThe Black Mirror Castle is now bigger but isn't better. Rooms and main hall look vast and spacious with their high ceilings and whatnot. However, 37% of the castle are pointless corridors you have to shamble through to get where you want to go and here comes the next thing. It's confusing, I felt lost through my entire playthrough, there are dead ends. Navigating initial iterations of the castle from the previous games came natural. It's also less goth and less castle-ly.\n\nSecond thing is physical navigation. This game doesn't want to be played with a keyboard nor controller. \nFrom the very beginning you're greeted with narrow passages that are layered with invisible walls. \nAs if that wasn't hard enough the fixed camera positions come to aid. They're immersive yet it all goes to waste when you get stuck on a mini-pixel of an invisible wall trying to go around it.\n\nAnother mechanic indicating the game's lack of desire to be played is death. When you have visions, coming too close to the ghosts gets you killed, yet they want you to 'examine' them at each point of time. It's detective mode on loop. I've been stuck dying over and over the first time I came in contact with this mechanic. Not realising what I should be doing, as it seemed that the ghost would attack me no matter what I did with how the scene played out and where the protagonist was standing. Also the cut to the death cutscene didn't do much to explain what happened in actuality.\nIt felt as if this was left in there just to extend your time in the game. Just like the supporting character who follows you but she has the light and she doesn't walk as fast as you do. The problem is you can't really see what's in front of you.\n\nShoutout to TomGamer for his playthrough in the guides section. Had to use it because some of the few puzzles that are presented to you are damn hard. The girl he played with is bae \ud83d\ude33",

I did not have so many problems that others said about the game, maybe it's been fixed or just luck. I did meet a bug only one time, the character could not move after a conversation, and I needed to load the last save to proceed. Saving frequently is recommended. The story is average or a little bit above average. It's too short, the whole story happens in only two nights.

I wasn't sure, at first, if this was supposed to have anything to do with the previous series but soon enough I could tell that it was a completely different story line - yet based around the same premise.\n\nThis game was much easier to play than the others, and took place in a much smaller world - i.e. less places to visit.  I didn't have to consult a walkthrough even once because of being lost in the game.  While usually that is a good thing, this game was far less complex than the previous series, and took much less time to play through.  The controls were also very annoying at times, having to stand in certain places to get the \"examine\" to pop up, etc. Very clunky. Not worth $30 in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR Good story, easy playthrough, pretty annoying controls.  If you're interested, pick this up in a sale as I do not think it is worth the full asking price - when compared to the earlier Black Mirror games.",

Just when I thought I was ready to put it down and go to bed, I was intrigued by something else, and kept going on.\n\nPros:\n- Like-able protagonist and sidekick\n- Interesting characters (though not all are like-able)\n- An intriguing mystery that continues to unravel chapter by chapter\n- Interesting puzzles that are not too challenging\n- Quick controls (I think they must have been fixed since previous reviews)\n- Creepy yet somewhat cozy atmosphere\n- Very few jump scares (if any - nothing made me jump, and I'm a jumpy person)\n- An original story that is much different than the original series\n- Quest log (keep track of tasks)\n\nCons:\n- Poor camera angles at times while walking around\n- Quick-time sequences that can be pretty difficult to complete (during visions)\n- No map (I learned my way around pretty quickly, but it's still helpful)\n- Very quick and somewhat unsatisfying ending (lack of a thrilling, prolonged climax)\n- Somewhat short (took me 8 hours to complete, but this is half the time than each game in the original series)",

The puzzles are very logic based and paying attention to things you see.

The controls, as pointed out by many already, are awful...no matter the graphics settings, movement lags behind key response (being slow, as if moving through sludge, difficult to aim in the direction you want to go, and at times continuing to walk even when you stop pressing the buttons).  Camera angles, combined with movement issues, make it easy to miss hot spots (which don't show up unless you get close enough to them).  On the subject of the hot spots, there are some glitches with them as well.  Sometimes, clicking on something to investigate will register as two clicks instead of one, leading to skipped dialogue.  Other times (and this is especially occurring during quick-time events), clicking doesn't register at all.  When this occurs during quick-time events, the end result has you maddeningly clicking the important parts, only to see the main character die over and over and over again...until you suddenly get lucky enough for it to register.  The slow movement also make it difficult to get through the quick-time events, as spending too much time navigating between hot spots and getting to a safe distance leads to a game over (again, repeatedly aggravating).  \n\nOther graphical glitches include background blurring during movement (I only noticed this in outdoor scenes), characters sliding into position rather than walking, mannequin-esque interactions (scenes where characters have a dialogue...yet they aren't even facing each other, eyes staring off into the distance, though there are some head and mouth movements), black screens randomly popping up during cut-scenes (not talking about the loading screen, but the actual cut-scenes...though you will still be able to hear what is happening), and the main character disappearing halfway into the ground when moving around some areas.\n\nThe game just feels lazily unpolished.  If the story was not interesting, I would have refunded this.  As it is now, I would say only buy it if it is on sale for a large discount.",

  "review": "Well, so here I am. Feeling like I want to play good point'and'click games again. Like an old times. My whole childhood was filled with a bunch of good p'n'c. I remember how I was sitiing on the last lesson at school already dreaming about coming to my place, eating my lunch and solving different puzzles in another adventure, drinking mommy's cocoa. \n\nIt was a golden era. If you was stuck - you was stuck. No internet solutions, no easy-get walkthroughs. Like literally, the only source of help you could rely on was your schoolmates. Unfortunately, I was surrounded with kids which were fond of strategy games and CS 1.6, so I was all alone in my adventures. \n\nThen I grew up, my childhood ended, everything changed, including my gaming taste. I felt like I wanted to play more FPS games, arcade, I was a big fan of NFS as well, so I guess I totally forgot about such genre as p'n'c / adventure. Earlier this year I started to play these games again and I had a feeling like I was back in my childhood again. Except one thing - puzzles seem much more easier to solver and, more importanly, it's much more harder to impress me with a plot in such games. Usually, every single adventure game, especially on detective subject, starts really intriguing and the further you come to the end of the game, the better you understand that the story is not that rich actually, and the whole intrigue lasts only for the first couple of hours. Then, most of these games end pretty much fast with a bitter taste.   \n\nBlack Mirror was one of that unexpected games for me, you know. A game, that I never heard about, just saw it on the store and felt like buying. The only thing that I realized quite fast, was that this game has a connection to the game, which I was never able to get when I was kid, with the same name, 2003 year release. Unfortunately, I must say, that this game is another example of why Steam needs to have a neutral review option ASAP.\n\nLet's start with saying that his game has a great atmosphere and, like I said before, starts really intriguing. You are playing as David Gordon, a young traveler, living in India, which received a telegram, saying that his father died under mysterious circumstances and left him an enormous mansion in heritage. When he comes to that mansion he meets a bunch of strange old people, having a lot of secrets and trying to avoid questions, connected with his father death. So, at this point you start your own investigation to find out what happened to your father and reveal the truth. \n\nThe whole game concentrate at one place, that big mansion, obviously. Which is pretty much disappointing, cause you can literally count on your fingers the quantity of locations in the Black Mirror. Another disappointment was puzzles. Don't get me wrong - puzzles are good in BM, but it's just few of them. Mostly, the whole game concentrate on its story and your interactions with surroundings and talking to other characters in game. It can be confusing sometimes, because you can stuck in game for a long time, just to realize after few hours, that you missed a small piece of something in the darkest corner of the library. The worst part of the game is its wonky controls and drunk camera plus it's bugging and glitching time to time. Oh, almost forgot - these 10 seconds of loading between rooms are just one of the most annoying things in gaming history.\n   \nBut despite all of these problems, I still recommend to try this game, being an p'n'c fan. It has its own charm, atmosphere and the idea, though it wasn't developed to its fullest. This game can be a perfect one to spend two evening with your girlfriend, you know, solving puzzles and trying to unravel all the mysteries together.\n\nSo, to sum everything up!\nYou should grab this game if you:\n\n+ Point and click lover! Though, it's not p'n'c in its usual understanding, because you move your character with WASD configuration\n+ Love to solve puzzles and mysteries\n+ Love games with its deep dark atmosphere and good graphic\n+ Wanna play something chilling, good and short. You can finish this game in around 4-5 hours.\n+ Looking for a simple game to enjoy it with your girlfriend, or just someone who is not involved in games that much.\n+ Want to have another +1 perfect game in your collection. There is no hidden achievements, no special one, no speedrun challenges - nothing. Easy as that - finish the game, receive all at once, done!\n\nYou should pass if you:\n\n- Can't stand wonky controls and unexpected camera moves. Sometimes it can be annoying as hell and if you are easy tilted person - better avoid.\n- Expect a deep story with a twist and unexpected outcome. Frankly speaking, the whole story is quite simple and its definitely nothing new or special about it. Additionally, there are not so much characters in this game, so it won't be hard for you to realize who is the bad guy closer to the middle of the game.\n- Played previous Black Mirror games and expect something overwhelming and better than its original.\n- Not that big fan of games of this genre, better wait till its on sale and patched a bit.\n\nEnjoy!",

I beat the game in under 9 hours but was left wanting more\n\nRecommended.",

  "review": "1. This game feels VERY RAW. The controls are so not good even with a controller, that could be considered an attempt on your life (funnily enough, I remember playing Fahrenheit with a keyboard and a mouse, and it felt more natural), the graphics are good for the most part, but in some places are just poor or glitchy, the loading between screens will leave you enough time to grate your teeth properly, and not like in the rest of modern games, where you get interrupted right when you begin. If any of this is a problem, turn away now. \n\n2. It's a complete reboot of the series with roughly the same mystical lore as the first game, but with completely different characters and their stories. To be really honest, the lore kinda sucks - it wasn't a strength of the original game, and it's not a strength here. The characters and their stories really shine, though. \n\n3. The closer to the end, the more rushed the game feels. Wouldn't mind more dialogues, wouldn't mind more writing in general, but all in all, it's decent. If it wasn't a dual choice, I'm not sure I'd recommend it, but the memories that linger are rather pleasant.  \n\n4. The main characters' duo is really nice, and I wish there could be more games featuring them. I highly doubt this will ever happen, though.\n\n5. If you're new to the series and an English-speaker, this is the best way to experience it. The first game made by Future Games is really awesome (for the most part), except the protagonist is voiced by someone who rather shouldn't have voiced the protagonist. The sequels were made by a different studio and were kinda mediocre, albeit had nice pacing and rather pleasant relaxed gameplay. Still, everything you could love the original for was stolen from them. This reboot, however, has enough worthy original elements to justify its existence.\n\nSo it's a lukewarm YES, go play it, it's a decent game with a dark atmosphere, there're not a lot of those.",

  "review": "Great game! You absolutely have to use a controller though, and if you do it feels good. (Keyboard and mouse is unplayable)  It's not long, and you are limited to the mansion and surrounding immediate area this time around. However, the detail, graphics, mood and sound are excellent and make you feel immersed. The story is good, the characters and voice acting included. Absolutely recommended, I hope they do the full series!",

  "review": "A well voiced adventure with a decent story, which at times can be pretty creepy. But there simply aren't enough puzzles in my opinion and people who have played point'n'click(-ish) adventure games in the past will find them too easy. Also for an adventure game it just seems too straight forward (i've played enough adventure games where i got annoyed by how criptic they can be but this one just overdoes the instructions given, i feel.) On the technical aspect: The game only crashed once on my entire playthrough, tho i have encountered a lot of graphical errors, mistimed sound effects and voices and overall bugs, which did not break the game but take a lot away from the atmosphere. Overall it feels a bit unfinshed but ok for the price point. I've finished the game in only about 5 hours which i blame the difficulty of the few puzzles it has for.\n\nTLDR:\n\n+(mostly) good voice acting\n+creepy atmosphere\n+good looking visuals....\n-...which get ruined by glitches a lot\n-not enough puzzles and the few there are, are not very challenging\n-bugs",

  "review": "Multiple game breaking bugs, in my 2 hours of gameplay I've encountered 3.. The first one right at the start of game that meant I had to play through the whole intro again, sluggish controls, loading screen simulator 2k17 as there's a loading screen for absolutely everything.. Weird af camera that half the time makes no sense.\n\nBrilliant sound design, pretty cheesy but enticing story with palpable twists, memorable characters, good music, awesome voice acting, graphically I mean it's not the worst by far.. Puzzles are well thought through and very 'The Room' styled. Horror not done cheaply, the game itself has the right amount of atmosphere.\n\nFor now I feel the cons outweigh the pros, but, I like puzzles so I'll probably finish it anyway, get it on sale or after its been updated if at all and only if you REALLY like puzzle games. For a better overall game, for the same price, and ironically a smaller team, buy Hellblade Senua instead til this is updated.",

  "review": "Just a quick review of Black Mirror : \n\nThe game is pretty good so far, If you liked Black Mirror I-III and you are interested to find out more about the Gordons you might wanna give this a go! The graphics are pretty for a Point and Click Adventure, the voice acting is good (playing the german dub though, so can't say if the english version is as good). There is one thing though you need to know : \n\nThis game is clearly optimized for playing with a controller! \nI played the first hour without and the next hour with controller and it made a HUGE difference. So If you have a controller..use it. Keyboard and Mouse feels a bit weird in this, could've been solved better. \n\nIf you haven't played any of the other Black Mirror games you should be fine, you would just know a bit more about the Gordon family. I do recommend playing Black Mirror I-III before though and maybe wait until this Black Mirror got a bit cheaper if money is an issue.\n\nEDIT 1 : \n\nCan't recommend playing with Headphones, there is this awful deep noise in the entire castle..I'm sure that It is there to add tension, to make Castle Black Mirror feel \"creepy\", but with headphones it sounds just plain awful, google \"Super Deep Brown Noise\" then you'll know what sound I mean..it's hard to describe.",

  "review": "I just finnished the game and I liked it.  The controls are a bit anoying at first but you get use to them.  My character did get stuck a few times on the enviroment but I was able to wiggle it free.  The game is pretty and I found the story interesting.  It is inspired by the original series but different in its own way.  It told its story and I felt like it was satisfying to finnish and uncover the story with the character.  The puzzles are not hard at all and the way they are solved and the way you can use the mouse to look at them feels natural, similar to what you would do irl.",
