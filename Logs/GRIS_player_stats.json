There's no fall damage and death mechanics in this game, you can play this in a relaxed way at your own pace. \n\nRarely has a game made me emotional to the point I would tear up, but this did. Perhaps the grief of losing someone and the journey of acceptance was something I could associate myself with. \n\nHighly recommend this game if your into relaxing/chill genre. 10/10 GG.",

  "review": "Gris is a stunning game by all measures. The artwork here takes the phrase \"every frame a painting\" to a whole new level. Seriously, I've literally never seen anything like it. The music is also incredible, and one of the few game soundtracks I listen to outside the game. This game tells a beautiful, heart-wrenching, emotionally gripping story all without a single line of dialogue, map, quest-log, or objective marker. There's not even a UI! It's really a study in minimalism in that way. The story's themes resonated with me deeply, as I felt like it was describing an emotional state I've been through several times in quite a profound manner.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but engaging, with basic environmental puzzles and some light metroidvania aspects. That doesn't mean it's open-ended or that there's backtracking, it's not and there isn't. I just mean in the sense that you pick up new abilities as you go along that are thematically tied to each level and allow you to progress past some obstacles. Overall, gameplay was the shallowest element of the game, but was engaging enough to keep me interested for the short runtime. It only took me about 5 hours to beat, while getting almost all of the secrets.\n\nTechnicals: \n - Gris runs *almost* flawlessly in an ultrawide aspect ratio (24:10 in my case) with a simple fix you can find online. There are only a small handful of incidences (like 4) where the edge of the the screen gets cut off briefly.\n - The game runs very smoothly.\n - A few assets here and there are just a little too low-res for 4k, along with the very few (I think there are 2) pre-rendered cut scenes, but it's far from distracting.\n\nIf this game looks at all interesting to you, please support the creator and try it out. It's a truly wonderful and unique game that more people should experience.\n\n4.5/5",

The music is definitely spectacular, and there were many times that I took screenshots for a background. \n\nMy only point of (more constructive than negative) feedback is the lack of inbuilt support for widescreen. This game looks beautiful, so whynot capitalize on this element? I managed to make it widescreen without too much hassle with the help of an online guide and a hex editor, but whynot build it in if its possible?\n\nAll in all, a very meaningful, strong elements of sorrow and beautfy throughout, well worth the price!",

The story is told through cinematic cut scenes at the beginning and end of levels but I felt the gameplay in between those moments did nothing to build on the themes of the game. It deals with \"depression\" in such a generic and unspecific way, there are countless movies, books, and tv shows that handle this topic much better, and are much more entertaining. Also ridiculously short.",

GRIS is one of those games that almost effortlessly invites you into a lived experience, an unfolding revelation. You might think \"One of those games? How many of those are there?\" That's the point. A limit approaching zero.\n\nGRIS is easy to underestimate and overlook in the modern gaming environment. But if you take the time to look into this game, you may find something deeply moving. Something that tears you down and builds you up. Something richer than the shades of gray in today's limitless gaming queues.",

It's more of an art type game, where you can relate to the character, the scenery, the story, all without her saying a word.\nThe soundtrack is incredible as well, I often listen to it while studying.",

  "review": "Overall, 9/10. Beautiful experience, very worth playing. \n\nThe sound design is absolutely gorgeous. The level design & art is stunning. It's an emotional experience. The only criticism I have is the game play itself is a little dull at times. Hunting for lights while trying to test which platforms are actually platforms and not just part of the background isn't that fun. But the elegance of the game makes up for those minor grievances. It's difficult to explain why this game is so emotional, since there isn't a very clear reason for what is happening or why, yet the gentle music and watercolor painted environment conveys a reverberating emotional theme that is compelling and artful. \n\nVery good game. Would strongly recommend it.",

  "review": "Knowing this game is pretty hyped I went in with high expectations. But somehow GRIS didn't click for me on any level.\n\nVisuals are pretty good and interesting but I can't call them gorgeous. Just pretty.\n\nMusic is pleasant but nothing stuck in my mind. It's a good background but I have no desire to listen to it outside of the game.\n\nStory is a mixed bag. It's about acceptance of loss and the ending is pretty cute. But in general it is a pretty simplistic take on a complex matter and for me it was not enough.\n\nGameplay almost non-existent. Walking simulator in side-scrolling perspective with very basic puzzles. Besides, it's extremely short for its price, with some exploration it took less than 4 hours to finish GRIS.\n\nI am not saying this game is bad. I just didn't feel engaged with story or gameplay during my playthrough. For the most part I felt bored. Sadly for me GRIS was a waste of money and time.",

  "review": "\"Thanks GRIS for breaking my Screen Shot key!\"\n\nJokes aside i had fun with the game albeit short but ends well. This game is eye candy! Especially the last part of Stage 2 and the WHOLE of Stage 3 (cuz i like blue :D) the EEL is still scary tho. The abilities she eventually will have is new to me [spoiler]I CAN PRESS THE SING BUTTON INDEFINITELY[/spoiler] and the puzzles look hard but is easy (At least for me). The end part for some reason made me tear up.\n\n\n",

This game is just something else. As everyone in the reviews are saying: \"This is a work of art\" There was a lot of thought, care, passion, and emotion put into this tiny indie game. The levels are very relaxing, and easy to learn (for the most part), I also kinda like the text-less design, it makes it look more like a movie than a video game. But above all, the powerful soundtrack wraps the atmosphere and feels of the Gris world, and the struggle of the lost girl has to go through. \n\nBeyond 10/10 for me, It\u2019s worth every single baht I paid, and the four hours I spent on this. I really want to experience this all over again. \n",

The soundtrack is the second best thing in this game, literally, every track in this game gave me the SHIVERS, what a masterpiece score, fits so well for the game. Gameplay-wise is simple, fun with the puzzles, nothing mindblown about it. For the story tbh, I didn't focus that much on the deep meaning of the game (maybe because I was too distracted with the visuals/soundtrack xD) but I'm looking forward to knowing more about the story.

It's already been out for over two years, and when it first came out I watched my boyfriend at the time play it, but I just finished playing it for myself and it was a completely different experience. The music, the SFX and the art (the COLORS) are so breath taking, I found myself just quietly crying along with the character. Even though this game being visually and auditorily outstanding, the story itself is very humble (idk if that makes sense but hear me out). It's a visual and auditory representation of the 5 stages of grief, and you as the player have to go through that journey with her. Along with being an incredible game, I think this will also help people who have been through immense grief and trauma by showing them it's okay to feel this way. I know it certainly has helped me deal with my own sadness and traumas. \n\nI really love this game. You can see and hear how much love and effort the devs put into it and I appreciate that so much ;-;. 11/10 game, highly recommend <3",

The art direction combined with the amazing music and sound design is the number one thing to enjoy about the game. Especially its beautifully hand-drawn animation blew me away.\nThat said, Gris has just barely enough gameplay to be called a platformer, and yet at the same time, not quite enough story for me to call it anything else. The Story and Gameplay that Gris does have are very well thought out, but I'd argue it still doesn't quite warrant a playtime of 3 hours.\n\nOne thing is for sure though, Gris is beautiful!",

Her struggles, her kindness and hope intertwine with you and get you invested in her journey. One which, if you are anything like me, will leave you with tears welling in your eyes because of its beauty. \n\nIf you like simple puzzle platformers with gorgeous scenery and a beautiful story then don't do yourself the disservice of passing over this game.

  "review": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Good!\n\n[h1]Adventure[/h1]\n\nThere is no doubt that GRIS is a beautiful and remarkable game, however the flaws are worth nothing also.\n\nFirstly, the graphics are unique. GRIS is distinctive in its colour palettes and growing beauty that evolves as the game progresses. The only real downside of the graphics are that it can be difficult to differentiate what is background and what is an obstacle. This also makes it difficult to notice the subtleties such as breakable blocks in some parts of the game.\n\nThe music is good, but inconsistent. It seems to phase in and out during the quiet moments and appropriately become louder and emotional at the right moments.\n\nThe gameplay is where it gets interesting. Most of it involves traversing an evolving environment that is a beauty to explore. One substantial issue I have is that a regular aspect of the game involves collecting little pixels of light to progress. This gets quite stale and repetitive quickly. I would have liked to have seen a good chunk of it removed and it would have made it a more enjoyable experience for me. I thought it caused to game to be a bit drawn out towards the end and tarnished the final sections.\n\nThe story is also a bit odd. A quick search online tells me the story is based in grief, as do five of the trophies. This isn't very obvious in the game, but doesn't really detract from my enjoyment unless I begin questioning the point of the whole game. It comes as a bit overly avantgarde and pretentious to make the theme ambiguous (it could be depression, psychosis etc. as well as grief), but again this isn't really an issue for me.\n\nOverall, it was the last third of the game that felt a tad tedious, however this is still a very good game and I want to see more like this. Despite my score, this was a very welcome change from the AAA garbage commonly flooding the market at present time.",

  "review": "[h1]\"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\"[/h1]\n\nThere are some games that feel like more than just the sum of their parts. When every piece of the experience fits so perfectly well with the others, the result is more than just a combination of different parts: it becomes an entity of its own, a seamless package, a new whole of its own. No longer it is just the value of each fragment on its own; it becomes greater than itself.\n\nGRIS' success stems from this very concept. It is a package of stories, colors and sounds, compiled together in such a masterful way that they become inseparable from each other. The mesmarizing visuals, the beautiful soundtrack, and the simple yet powerful story they tell together, are integrated so well into each other that they cannot exist without the other anymore. It is through this seamless coupling that GRIS soars beyond what a game usually offers: it takes you on a journey where every part of the experience has been carefully crafted to do something just right. It's not difficult to see how much love and care the developers behind this game put into every little detail: whether it is the extra touches of attention in the beautiful levels, an extra audio piece to further immerse you in the story, or the tiny little hints spread throughout the game that let you understand it more. GRIS is more than just a game: it's a masterpiece.\n\nWhat I like a lot about GRIS is how it doesn't hinder the experience with unnecessary difficulty or repetitiveness. It knows exactly how much value it can give in a certain time frame, and makes sure to not over-do nor under-do it. The fact that the levels are fairly simple and easy to complete is a blessing, no a curse: it lets you stroll through the tale that GRIS tells without interruptions. This is part of the concept I explained above: to properly enjoy GRIS, you must experience it as an entire package and in a 'single fluid motion'. Adding extra complexity and tricky parts would've just slowed down the momentum the game builds, which in turn would've hindered the flow of it.\n\nAnd indeed, you can see how GRIS attempts to keep things simple not only through gameplay, but also in its world design and visual language. The entire art style is based around simple, primitive geometrical shapes and sharp, defined lines; what really empowers it is the usage of colors and distance to add 'depth' to the world, without adding complexity. It's a beautiful art style that is clearly the result of much effort, planning and research by the team behind it.\n\nThe soundtrack is what really wraps it all together for me. I am well known for my appreciation and attention to music in video games, and for me, GRIS' soundtrack ticked all the boxes without a doubt. The music that accompanies your adventure is not just a background layer: in many areas of the game it is as crucial to the experience as everything else - remember, seamless package! - and I had moments of real, genuine goosebumps throughout my playthrough that would've not happened if it wasn't for the amazing score.\n\nThere are very few games that leave me with such a lasting impact, but when the credits rolled for this one, I was left truly speechless. I really felt like I experienced something different, and I genuinely didn't want it to end. This, to me, is what proves it above all: [b]GRIS is a masterpiece.[/b]\n\nBravo, Nomada! Congratulations for successfully shipping such a wonderful creation.",

You will not be bored playing it, if you are here to experience the struggles of Gris in this beautiful world.\n\nThe art is like an eye candy, atleast for me.

I have still things such as collecting mementos, but the whole plot is already finished. Though, the story was one of those, that you do care about.

Despite being late to the party, I got this game last year. The one thing I regret about this game is not purchasing this sooner. \n\nThis game is unique in the sense that there won't be another platformer quite like this one. You can really see the attention to details when it comes to intricacy throughout the entirety of all the variously themed levels. The art style, mixed with the layouts are absolutely breathtaking. There are moments within each level I found myself just stopping and taking it all in, I feel as though you have to in order to really grasp everything this game is trying to portray, but why would you not? In a nutshell, the levels are works of art. \n\nThe story is silently powerful (no pun intended) for the most part you will go through each level with nothing other than the sound of your feet walking upon different terrain and the beautiful soundtrack. It makes the build up towards the ending that much more significant when you reach it, and it was that moment when I understood why people had been saying it was incredibly moving, and I couldn't agree more. I've never felt a literal rush of goosebumps towards a game quite like this.\n\nIf you're a fan of platformers and want something different, more on the artistic creative side towards a game. I definitely recommend this for you, being an artist myself made me appreciate the game for every pixel on the screen. However, anyone and everyone should get this game and definitely look at everything. It will only make the ending to the story that much greater as a viewer/player.",

  "review": "[i]So you\u2019ve finished the game \u2013 what do you think?[/i] Well, this question\u2019s off the point. Gris belongs to the genre I prefer to call Game-Experience. These are games, where cognitive and logical take the back seat to the emotional. Thus, the proper question would be \u2013 [i]what do you feel?[/i]\nI [i]feel[/i] Gris is a bit like Journey \u2013 one of the better Games-Experiences out there. I mean Gris even starts in a desert. Yet I must say the emotional pull here is a tad more pronounced. That can be viewed from two sides \u2013 while it is certainly on the positive side if you are looking for this sort of thing (high chance that you do), you can say that emotional beats sweeping over you like the in-game color hurricane, can mask some apparent downsides of the game. \nI [i]feel[/i] those downsides would be wonky platforming (you can see it\u2019s not that great when developers are forced to automate them during some cutscenes). And oh, yeah \u2013 cutscenes. You know, unskippable ones. I [i]feel[/i] these are beyond annoying, especially during the achievement hunt. Also, you can probably say there is not that much gameplay in this game and emotional tides try to mask this \u2013 sure, yet I personally [i]feel[/i]  it\u2019s enough for this kind of game and they really put an effort into making each part unique and infusing the game with as much variety as possible for its short span. I mean \u2013 it even has variable \u2018boss fights\u2019 in line with a theme of each Chapter. Piloting the game during these moments makes you [i]feel[/i] exactly what the developers wanted you to [i]feel[/i] \u2013 the gameplay fulfills its emotional function. \nOf course, I [i]feel[/i] I can\u2019t sum up without mentioning the elephantine aspect in the room of reviewing \u2013 visuals, art style and music are all gorgeous. I mean, provided you have eyes and ears \u2013 I [i]feel[/i] it\u2019s quite obvious from the trailer and screenshots. And I don\u2019t [i]feel[/i] visuals and music are the only thing that gives this game it\u2019s worth \u2013 the main theme behind the game is surprisingly serious. Such solemn themes of loss and picking yourself up after loss are not often looked upon in a whimsy feelgood medium of videogames.\nAnd yet, at its culmination\u2026 the game just sort of stops. I certainly [i]feel[/i] the ending is very abrupt, especially comparing it to the benchmark Journey \u2013 missing is that amazing endgame flight or something of the same caliber. Without it the ending lies flat and [i]feels[/i] the same. \nApart from that I [i]feel[/i] this game is worthy to be An Experience - short, yet emotional trip. You can\u2019t really approach this type of games with preconceptions and notions about the wider game genre. Embrace the rollercoaster you got yourself on with its every aspect \u2013 and the ride will be worth the time and money spend. At least, that\u2019s what I [i]feel[/i].",

You're struck with how beautiful this game is all while feeling this sense of hopelessness and loneliness. There is no dialogue yet the music and art conveys the emotions perfectly. After losing 3 people closest to me in life within 2 years this game struck something in me, no matter how hard it is, you have to resist. You lose a part of yourself or break completely when you lose someone, all you can ever try to do is put yourself back together. Life and death are the only certainties in life and I think this game conveys all the hardships along the way.",

  "review": "I enjoy an artistic game but they're usually not this slow or boring, and they normally don't force you to finish the game before you can revisit anything. It seems at odds with itself, and I can't recommend it.\n\nEdit: finished the game now, and I grieve. I weep for the time and braincells lost forcing myself through it.\n\nThe dearth of checkpoints (and ability to backtrack at any given point) shows just how much the developers hate the player, since there are so many points where you might miss a simple jump or glide which makes all the difference between grabbing a hard-to-reach collectible or landing back on the story-railroad, having to wait until the end of the game to get another chance. At one point I was experimenting with smashing things, like mini-towers and statues, but the game wasn't having any of it. \"You wanted to see what interacting with these animated figures would do? Nope, FUCK YOU! Back on the railroad you go!\"\n\nThe harder you try to play it like a game rather than a self-playing piece of art, the more the game resists your efforts. The symbolism holds no meaning and doesn't even retain any relevance within any of the areas of the game, so you can tell the devs got lost at one point huffing their own farts and never looked back.\n\n\n\nThis should've just been an animated short movie or something, because as a video game, I feel ripped off.",

  "review": "In GRIS you awaken to your world being torn apart, everything you have known is crashing down around you as you lose yourself and fall into the abyss. You wake to a desolate world of black and white as you deny what just happened. The world changes around you as you evolve, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance and with those feelings come colours too, each depicting a state of mind which is radiated by the environment around you. In each area come puzzles not made to trap you but instead to make you feel growth and accomplishment. These challenges are equally a perfect way to let loose the artistic talent present in this game.\n\nGRIS has one goal in mind, conveying emotions, and it does that perfectly through the astonishing art and attention to detail. All the way to the animations, sounds and background music that are simply captivating. In GRIS gameplay is a mere vessel for emotion, there is no barrier between you and the game, no speech and no text if we don't count the minimalistic tutorial. Hell there isn't even a story apart from a vague sense of growth and accomplishment. It's you and the game nothing else, that's what makes GRIS so enjoyable. Nomada Studio has made a masterpiece of a game that manages to captivate you emotionally like nothing else with but one character that doesn't say a word.\n",

  "review": "Quick:  \n\n5/5.  This game is great.  I absolutely loved it.  Gris is an Indie atmospheric puzzle platforming game.  The game utilizes artwork and music to dish out the full experience.  Visually and audibly the game is outstanding.  For a long time, I put off playing this game.  The marketing didn't really give me the impression that I would like it very much.  I picked it up on sale, and I was stunned by how much I enjoyed it.  This has easily become one of my favorite games ever.  Perfect score, for a perfect game.   \n\n\nMore:\n\nI loved playing this game.  There isn't enough space available on a Steam review for me to fully express how much I enjoyed it.  The story is very vague.  I'm still not sure what this game is about.  That type of storytelling can be an asset to a game, if it is done right.  If it is done wrong, it can ruin a game.  Here, it is done perfectly.  \n\nI could not get enough of the artwork of Gris.  Everything, from the smallest vase to the largest mountain looks beautiful.  The music is even better.  And, the game-play is done right.  I don't play many games that get everything right.  Gris gets everything right.  This game is, in my sincere opinion, perfect.\n\nThe story is very unclear.  You play as a girl who (I think) has lost her voice.  You begin a journey for an unknown reason, and you bring back different colors to the world by solving puzzles and platforming through obstacles.  Along the way, you will meet a few characters and engage with a few enemies.  There is an ever-present antagonist along the way.  \n\nI believe that much of the art is hand-drawn here.  Lots of the levels have what appears to be pencil-outlines building the grass, trees, and characters.  There is also a more flat, and perfectly straight edged look to other things.  Not everything in the world appears to be done in the same art-style.  The colors and shapes of the world vary a great deal.  It is amazing to look at.\n\nThe music is phenomenal.  I loved it all.  Most of it is soft and airy, but there are a few moments in the game when the music hits very hard.  It becomes dramatic and almost scary.  This game is well paced, and the music does a good job conveying that.  It never felt dull or repetitive.  It isn't overdone, and it is seasoned perfectly.\n\nGame-play, overall, is surprisingly good.  The main character controls flawlessly.  I have never had a single issue with attempting to control the character.  There are several puzzles, ranging from easy to moderately difficult.  All of them are engaging and fun to solve.  It is a short game.  I prefer that, and I have no problem with it.  If you do not like short games... then this isn't for you.  There's about 3 hours of game-play here, on a standard run through.  It is the perfect length for me.  It doesn't overstay its' welcome, and it doesn't become repetitive or boring.  Everything here is just right.\n\nI wish that I would have played this game sooner.  It is an amazing experience.  It has changed the way that I look at games, forever.\n",

  "review": "This was wonderful. I really needed something like this after seven long months of quarantine and isolation.\n\nEverything about Gris is breathtakingly beautiful. The lovely hand-drawn art style, the vibrant watercolors, and the amazing ethereal music make it an absolute treat for the senses. Every single frame is wallpaper worthy -- I ended up taking a hefty 662 screenshots by the time the credits rolled. It's easily one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played.\n\nThe story is subtle yet serves its purpose. What is present exists more to invoke emotion rather than convey a complex plot. As far as I can tell, it is allegorical for a young woman suffering from grief/depression and her attempts to overcome it. (This really struck a cord with me after so long in quarantine.)\n\nI don't normally play, nor particularly enjoy, platformers, but Nomada Studio did a stellar job with Gris. The exploration and progression felt natural and smooth. I never once became stuck nor lost and yet I never felt like the game was holding my hand either. It's about as close to seamless as possible. \n\nIt's beyond me how there are still people who don't consider games an art form. If Gris doesn't prove that sentiment hilariously wrong, nothing in the world will. Definitely get this one if it appeals to you.",

Music matches perfectly with the game, Berlinist did a really good job and I will for sure check their work.\nThere are puzzles, but nothing too complicated, maybe sometimes it will take a little bit longer to solve some of these. Just observe closely the ambient, the solution can be easily found.\n\nMake yourself a favor: if you want to play something different and with high production value, you need to play it.

  "review": "As an artist, Gris has always interested me. To be honest, I thought it would be just a pretty game to look at, similar to Journey or Flower for the PlayStation. I was surprised with the gameplay. It's not just a simply move from A to B in a liner path. There is actual puzzle solving and multiple paths. Granted, it is pretty simple. It's not \"Limbo\" or \"Braid\" level of puzzles. Overall the game only took me just over 2 hours to finish. I did very much enjoy the overall experience. Would this have been good 10 hours long exactly as is? Personally, no. However, the idea of the puzzles where interesting and it's something worth expanding on. Gris is about feeling though. The emotionally impact of fear and lose. The art style along with the music really hit me. Gris is stunning. I've played a lot of games, and it's not everyday I actually stop and stare at a games visuals in silence. This is the most beautiful game I've ever seen.

In just about 3 hours, without even a word being said, the story will make you feel like you are dreaming, make your heart pound and your eyes tear up.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, yet incredibly engaging. The way the abilites visually work is so satisfying, making the game feel good to play. The puzzles aren't mind breaking, but you still need to put your brain to work to solve them.\n\nThe soundtrack is on Hollow Knight levels without a doubt. One amazing detail about it is how it notably changes as the game goes. I'm not gonna spoil the story, but there's a reason for things to change, and the music changing along adds a lot more love to it.\n\nBut what I love the most is the evolution of the plot and how that changes the atmosphere. The changes our character goes through actively change the whole environment, and by definition, the levels. \n\nI played the game in one sitting and got every collectible and achievement in just less than 6 hours. I genuinely wish I could forget about it so I could play it all over again and feel what I felt one more time, as it was the first. This game has a special place in my heart, you should definetly try it.",

This game is more for the experience than for a challenge. The levels aren't very tough and are very forgiving, allowing you to relax and fully enjoy the art and sound in each world. You can enjoy a bit more of a challenge by trying to get all of the optional collectibles in each world which require you to solve platforming puzzles.\n\nThe game isn't very long. I completed it in about 3 hours while trying to explore every corner of the map and doubling back a lot. You'll likely be able to finish it in an afternoon and get everything you'd want out of it.\n\nIt was an enjoyable experience that reminded me of how beautiful well designed games can be.\nIf you're the type to consider getting this game, you're probably also the type that wouldn't regret the purchase.",

It's environmental story telling is on point. It lets you enjoy its world while subtly giving you the message/story behind it. You experience this art as a girl who is dealing with painful experience in life. This game has no text story, no voice acting but the journey was so awe inspiring and emotional that in the end I had shed tears. Whether it was a tear of joy or sorrow I did't know. But I like to believe that those were of joys as the girl was able to accept everything around her and got her courage to deal with it.\n\nI would like to praise this piece of art to sky with words as it is, simply put, a masterpiece.

For example, some sliding sequences in GRIS prevent the player from moving, making them less fun than Journey's. It also includes dust storms like the snow storms in Journey, but they're harder to avoid in 2D space.\n\nIt tries to enforce gameplay rules but tends to break them at random. For example, demonstrating the player can't walk through pillars, before requiring the player to swim through pillars in Chapter 4. Also in Chapter 4, using light to indicate underwater pathways, but then placing lights next to walls. As a puzzle game this makes it confusing.\n\nHaving said this, GRIS offers many new concepts which make it interesting and unique. It has a different purpose, with far more puzzle solving than Journey.",

It makes the artistic sequences that scream \"danger\" boring. This is meant to be a story of a young girl growing emotionally, but she does so without any assistance from the player. With no threat of failure, there are no challenges to overcome.\n\nThis game had SO much potential as a metroidvania style game that truly let the player feel like they were growing. The game didn't need much danger, but there's a particular scene in the game that would have MASSIVELY benefited with actually requiring player input.\n\nInstead of being able to put my mind into the body of this character, it felt like I was watching from afar.

This music plays an integral part in lifting GRIS from an already astounding game into something utterly gorgeous.\n\nI cannot fault this title in any way, and if it wasn't for Hades taking my GOTY spot for 2020 I would have chosen GRIS hands down (although yes, I am a little late to the party as it was released in 2018) But still, none the less this is easily one of the best games I have played all year, if not years.\n\nIf you appreciate video games that push the boundaries of just what is possible within the medium through visuals, narrative and aural sensations you must try GRIS, it is an experience like no other.\n\n[b] 10 /10 [/b]",

There is no profanity, in fact, there is no dialogue at all, other than simple notices for new controls as you gain new abilities. Then there is the soundtrack, adventurous and fast-paced if need be, tranquil and calm everywhere else. The music helped make every puzzle enjoyable.\n\nNext is the story. GRIS proves that you don't always need dialogue to tell a story at all. The imagery and the cutscenes describe a hopeful young girl dealing with painful experiences. During her journey, she progresses through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance as she gains new abilities to traverse her world, before coming to a beautiful conclusion.\n\nAnd then there is the art. Every scene is a watercolor painting fit for an art gallery. In her world, the girl finds colors, first red, then green, then blue, and finally yellow. The world comes to life through finding these colors in conjunction with her progression through grief, as red deserts make way for green forests, which lead to blue oceanic landscapes, before finally opening up to gardens of yellow lights. Thus, every landscape is a sight to see; every landmark a work of art.\n\nTake the time to relax. Sit back, relax, and enjoy a peaceful game away from the hectic world.",

  "review": "Just because I am saying I recommend this game, it doesn't mean this game isn't hugely problematic. It's very pretty. The level design is well-thought-out. It subtly addresses a mental health theme using no words, and it puts a lot of emotion into it. However, this game really has nothing of substance to say about said mental health theme, and that's a huge problem. Want to play a game about grief? Sure, pick up GRIS. Want a new perspective or to learn something that will help you deal with said grief? That's not in here. There's really nothing in here of substance-- just the expression of grief itself and some symbolism of adding color back into your life.\n\nThis game was clearly inspired by Journey (the game, and the interview admits Journey as one of the inspirations), but I felt more strongly playing Journey than I felt while playing GRIS; and Journey's about lore instead of introspection, so it should have the disadvantage. It seemed like it was a huge pain to animate this game, and that's impressive. But they should have taken a page out of Journey when it came to gameplay mechanics, too. There's very few mechanics here; and the ones that are here aren't utilized nearly creatively enough.\n\nGames about mental health expression need to exist. But they also need to provide a little substance too. You don't need words to do that; so I'm not necessarily saying GRIS should add some narration or dialogue. Even some still-shot cutscenes could have done wonders for this game to help it provide perspectives, show how others may respond to the afflicted person, and/or give helpful advice.",

The game is only about 3-4 hours in length (if you don't bother going to get the rest of the collectibles) but it is also very inexpensive, especially on sale.\n\nI really do recommend this game. The main reason I recommend this game is because it brought about so many different emotions. I think that if a game can actually make you feel something, it's probably worth playing or experiencing. For a game with no words to do that...that's truly impressive. The game will definitely capture your attention. It will make you ask questions, and it will make you feel things, sometimes unexpectedly.\n\nThe largest issue with this game is the final cut-scene. It is a video clip of some rendering of the game, and the audio quality suffers very noticeably. First of all, this type of game revolves around the players' feelings and emotions. So hearing a lot of distortion in the audio did take me out of the game a bit. Secondly, it's the ending. The music is swelling, the animation is top-notch...but unfortunately both are impacted by the decision to put a lower-quality media there instead of making it in the game itself. I'm sure there was a reason for it, but it certainly did take me out of the game and lessened the emotional effect - resulting in a slightly disappointing ending. Despite this, I still enjoyed the game and recommend it.",

It is a quiet journey for the most part, where you explore a world that represents the protagonist's inner landscape while traversing various platforming puzzles. The puzzles are relatively simple and there is no combat, this is the type of game you would relax to, rather than the sort you would seek action in.\n\nI think that the art style alone speaks volumes about the beauty of this game, and since the gameplay is quite simple, every second will be an opportunity to admire it. The music that accompanies you throughout the game is very well done too.\n\nSo that's quite a bit of praise about this game, isn't it? What about the negatives? Honestly, there wasn't anything that stood out to me that I would rather have done differently. The only thing I would ask for is more of it, that is; the game is relatively short, taking only around 4-5hrs to complete (7hrs if you go for all the achievements).\n\ntl;dr - It is a beautiful hand-drawn platformer with light puzzles, absolutely worth it.",

I do recommend using a gamepad/controller for some puzzles as Keyboard and Mouse weren't that precise and got wonky.\n\nI only have two cons that I want to address here and first, the camera can be counter-intuitive at times, zooming in too closely and makes you do trials and errors for puzzles. Having a proper zoom at first would had helped.\n\nSecond gripe is the unsupported UltraWide monitor format, 21:9 ratio.

Obviously art and emotions are the strong point, but instead of focusing on that 100% and making this the art experience I feel like it was supposed to be, it just had to include random puzzle-like elements and platforming which just, in my opinion, don't fit this game.\n\nThe way the game starts makes the player feel like this is going to be a game where you barely have to think, and just walk towards your destination, a beautiful graphical experience. Instead, there are these sudden puzzle parts, don't get me wrong; they are not hard at all, but in my opinion, they break the atmosphere. \n\nI'm not saying it's a failure, for sure it's not highly rated for nothing. It's really pretty indeed, and I enjoyed that aspect of the game a lot. However, this game would've been so much better for me, if it had focused more on either the art experience or the puzzle/platforming. Some of the mechanics in this game were really great, but since it was only a little part of the game, i feel like it was a waste. The mentioned reasons are why I lean more towards not recommending this game - I'd give a neutral recommendation if I could.",

GRIS inspires me both as a gamedeveloper and an artist. The beatiful art made by the talented Conrad Roset combined with the smooth animations and the amazing soundtrack makes for a great experience, and it is truly the best example of an emotional game. \n\nThe way the game plays with your feelings is truly unique, i have atleast never experienced something like it before. The animations are as mentioned earlier very smooth, and everything moves in a way that truly pleases the eye. The gameplay isn't the most eyecatching thing, however that isn't really why you play GRIS. GRIS is about the story told through pictures and sound, and the minimalistic gameplay fits perfectly. The gameplay isn't unique, and the mechanics have been done before, but probably not in a way like this.\n\nIf i were to give this game a score, lets say 0 to 10 i'd simply tell you that it's maybe a 9 or a 10 or maybe even a 5. GRIS is not a game that should be scored like this because it simply won't tell you what this game is. The only way you can experience GRIS is by playing it, and i really think you should.

Its an excuse to enjoy a very elaborate interactive piece of collage or a painting trying to figure out its meaning and what the art is trying to express. This game is at its core, an artist's expression of his / her art and thoughts in video game form.\n\nThe game will last you about 3-4 hours depending on your playstyle.

There were certain things that stood out.  The swim ability made you feel like you were flying, the final stage encompassed all you had learned in an interesting way, the conclusion was... neat...  I wouldn't describe the game as boring.  I don't think it dragged on and it gave you a steady supply of new things to use and experience regularly enough that it worked alright.  The greatest thing about this game was definitely its beauty.  If you consider yourself an artistic person you might appreciate the designs.

  "review": "[*English Review]\n[h1]GRIS is a statement to the [b]Games Are Art[/b] movement. It is one of the best games that showcase this theme.[/h1]\n\nGRIS showcases a very artistic style. Everything is simple and well put together, nothing bombastic, nothing that deters your experience of the game and what to developer wants to show and express.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to learn and easy to master. The Puzzles are pretty straight forward, one of the simpler puzzle-platformer games. While there are some challenges for the ones who want to get every achievement, the game doesn't throw you into a wall forcing you to stop and struggle at solving puzzles. They are pretty decent and later require a bit more out of box thinking, but still, there are doable in 2 or maximum 3 tries, being straightforward.\n\nThe game wants you to focus on the amazing soundtrack, situational moments, and impressive level design which blends so nicely with the theme.\n\nWhile the first chapters are maybe a bit too short, and nothing spectacular, apart from some funny and nicely thought interactions, GRIS game shines late game where it introduces a dark and light dynamic and also new concepts to the level design which brings in innovation and multiple ideas in the final 2 chapters.\n\n*Rambling*\nI have to say that the initial 3 chapters were a breeze and while interesting it didn't surprise me a lot, as I was familiar with puzzle-platformer games and I felt it a bit stale. But the last 2 chapters were great, so many innovations, and much more engrossing, would have preferred the first 3 to be more of the same.\n\nMaybe the first 3 were to set the pace of the last 2 but still would have preferred to explore more those environments.\nThe pace is still good, and I was expecting a shorter game seeing the initial 3 chapters, but the last 2 stands out.\n*End of rambling*\n\nGRIS portrays a bit of backtracking I have to be honest but usually, comparing to other games, it does it differently, so even if you return to a central spot occasionally, (closer to firm checkpoints) you do it in a different way than the one you went through. So there are multiple paths, 1 for going to the objective, and 1 which returns you to where you started. Usually, these checkpoints are at the middle moments of a chapter.\n\nApart from these occasional backtracks, the game is fairly linear but also allows you to explore both the left and right sides of the screen.\nBeing a puzzle platformer, you will be inclined that you need to go right in order, to advance, but no, not necessarily, not always, not even often. You will be surprised to know how often the left, is the right way. Still for the optimal discovery of the puzzles and achievements you should check both sides.\n\nI have to say that while initially, I didn't think this game should cost more than 9,99, I have to say that 14.99 or 16,99 is a fair price for what you get. Let me say this, if you come for the complexity of the puzzles, huge map, complicated movement or skill trees, or even rememberable story and characters then I might be afraid that you will not enjoy it that much.\n\nBut if you enjoy the art aspect and want a solid puzzle platformer game that will surprise you trough it, and find yourself engrossed in the environment and the exposition, then this game is for you.\n\nIt is a fun 1 session, maybe 2 sessions of gameplay. I finished in 4.7 hours but I AFK-ed on the menu as well. So it is roughly 3.2 hours. Pretty good, and if you find it at 9.99 then get it. It's worth it. I would like to see more.\n\nGRIS is a firm statement for Games are Art, alongside Flow, Flower, Journey, Ori and the Blind Forest, Ori and the Will of the Wisps and others.",

  "review": "Absolutely do not recommend this game. The gameplay is paced glacially, there are very few mechanics, and it feels like a caricature of itself in the \"art game\" genre. The story is not gripping and it seems to rely on the \"pretty girl\" appeal mixed with the watercolor aesthetic. Additionally, the slow framerate of the animations really emphasizes the clunky control, which is nigh-unforgivable in a platformer. Making a single mistake is eye-rollingly tedious as it takes an unreasonable amount of time to get back to where you were - particularly because of the slow movement and pacing.\n\nThe slow beginning of the game does very little to draw the player in or grip them with fun gameplay. I am fairly far through the game and simply don't care at all.\n\nI compare this to games like Journey or even Far: Lone Sails which rely on their art design and environments to draw the player in, but Journey is delightful to control in the mechanics department and doesn't take 20 minutes to introduce mechanics. Far: Lone Sails has actual conflict, tension, failure states, and an actual sense of urgency.\n\nThis concept would have been better served as a short animated film. It barely counts as a video game.",

I tried Gris once on the xbox gamepass and felt quite bored halfway and quit it. I decided to give the game a second chance and i'm glad i did. This game has amazing visuals and music. Dive into this game with expectations that you will not be playing a game but instead be experiencing a very lovingly crafted story. I did have some issues with the game, like in some places it's hard to differentiate the background from the foreground elements and some scripted chase sequences. I don't think that takes away any points from how good this game is though.

  "review": "Gris Gris Gris.. Where to begin?\n\nAs a seasoned gamer, Gris is truly a masterpiece, mainly for the fact that it is more of a piece of art than a game in itself. Of course it remains a game with some puzzles never too complicated for which you do not really have to use your brain and just enjoy the rest.\nAs previously mentioned, I would place this piece in works of art instead of a game for two reasons. First is the visual aspect where the game runs extremely smoothly, especially if you can push the FPS. Aside from the technical part, all animations and cutscenes have been overworked in a positive way as they are extremely detailed and something you would have to do various times becomes joyful and you never grow tireless. As for the the visuals overall, the world in which the game takes place is very relaxing and mesmerising, it's one of these views you can stare at for an undefined amount of time without getting bored. To finish on the visual aspect of the game, I just have to mention the colors. Rich, vivid and flowing. Never too much, never not enough. The developers have somehow found the perfect balance as to what is needed to soothe the eye and convert colors into magic.\n\nVisuals are nice but this game revolves more around the music and sounds in my opinion. As soon as the game starts, you get a taste of it, a taste of the most worked part of this masterpiece and it is without reason this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews. The music in itself tells a story and allows the player to further understand what is happening at any given time. It is the kind of music you can listen to in a loop over and over again. Needless to mention the soundtracks have been composed especially for this game and especially to fit every second and movement your character makes.\n\nOverall, this game is simply a treat for both eyes and ears. Playing this game is like going to the museum exposing your favourite artist or watching your favourite movie. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to spend a good time.",

There is a lot of work and attention to detail that went into GRIS, and creatively speaking I think the game is just fantastic. I also enjoyed some of the cool moments and things found in the gameplay, especially towards the second half. It boasts a beautiful soundtrack as well. That said, in reference to GRIS' \"simplicity\" I think this was somewhat of a flaw that holds the game back just a little bit. I just feel like this game needed a little bit more of something, especially in the gameplay area. I found the movement in the game to be too slow and I also feel that an extra mechanic or two would have really gone a long way to make things more fun. At the end of the day, the experience and gameplay gimmicks this game *does* have to offer are quite good and I highly recommend it to people who are open to playing a more relaxed and stylistic platforming experience, but if you're mainly looking for truly deep and engaging gameplay, this game may not be your cup of tea.",

  "review": "Boring and pointless, art for the sake of nothing, void of any form of identity.\n\n\nThe opening scene summarizes it pretty well. Singing girl loses her voice then falls. Why is the girl singing? Why does she fall? Is that supposed to be the player's motivation for going on this whole journey? To get the asininely singing girl's voice back? Why were there opening credits? How much of a bunch of egotists do the developers have to be to force players to look at the credits at the beginning of the experience, breaking the flow and immersion of the game in the process. Those weren't the full credits though I'm quite sure, only the contributors to the project that were deemed as having enough \"value\" and \"importance\" had the luxurious honour of wasting the player's time and destroying the immersion of the singing girl introduction. That is the immediate depth of the story, singing girl loses her voice. Infer whatever generic metaphor you want from that and call it the story.\n\nThe game goes on to offer the player practically nothing of value for their time. Players travel through stylized maps performing basic platforming and simple platforming puzzles which are dressed up in aesthetics to make them look much more interesting than they really are. There's is no real story beyond the nonsensical \"metaphorical\" tale likely being told through this arbitrary course of events. And even that is bare, most of the scenery is just generic scenery there's very little unique things in the environment to parse a metaphor from and even then what is it possibly going to be. Troubled protagonist has problems. They even tell you that in the game description, you already know. Look at all the stone statues of crying figures, is it obvious yet that the protagonist has problems. What a metaphor.\n\nThe collectibles are just glittering ring things, they give nor tell the player anything. The player simply finds it and acquires it and that's it. Meanwhile every location is just a place. This is clearly not a world, these are clearly not places with names and histories, this is just a bunch of pointless artistry meant to convey a shallow metaphor that could be explained to the player in minutes or less. The art is not even especially impressive either. It's art, art that would be expected for a game that would in turn have gameplay and a story. But there's no real story and the gameplay is just typical platforming.\n\nWhy bother. Each location is just another pointless place the player will jump through, encountering some variance in the platforming mechanics, find a couple of glowing rings, then move on over and over until it's all done. Maybe there'll be another unique cutscene or two, further compounding the obscure and shallow metaphor of the protagonist's struggle.\n\nThe moments where the game randomly takes control away from the player and does things for them feels like the most honest points in the experience. Why should the player be expected to control the protagonist, why not just have a bot do it. The player can sit back and gawk at the soulless art assets while listening to the forgettable piano music in the background. The bot doesn't even have to be coded to skip through dialogue; since there isn't any, nor does it have to be coded to find secrets since they give you practically nothing anyways.\n\nOr players could find a game that also has decent art, better music, but with an actual story that has actually engaging gameplay.",

  "review": "Its amazing. Once every few years I play a game and I leave it somber, not from sadness of the topic it covers, but more a sadness of finality. The kind of game that takes your character, and you along with them, on a journey that seems to change both of you. Its a feeling of joy, as it is a resolution to what you have been working for, but it is also a sadness, as there is no more of that journey to play anymore. I finished the game less five minutes ago and I am now writing a review trying to convince you to spend your hard earned money on it. I don't write reviews. I almost never recommend games, not even those I play for hundreds of hours. If a game can make me feel such a whirlwind of anxiety, relief, sadness, joy, despair, and hope in just less than four hours without using a single word, than it deserves to be played. \n\nThe music is phenomenal, the art is beautiful, the story is impactful. \n\nPlease, just buy it.",

  "review": "Phew. Telling how to deal [spoiler]with a loss[/spoiler] ... maybe with too much pathos at times, but nevertheless, it does it well. There's no text or speech, just symbolism, music, displayed emotions and telling Steam achievements. [spoiler]Like: You search \"Mementos\". Or: After four stages I found a hidden statue which unlocked the achievement \"Depression\". If you've ever heard about the concept of the five stages of grief, this gives away quite a bit.[/spoiler]\n\nThe gameplay is light puzzle platforming which can be a bit frustrating from time to time when you miss a jump and returning takes way too long. That said, I'm not particulary a fan of platforming and I suck at it, so you might not face the struggle I had from time to time.\n\nFor most parts it feels like a well-made walking simulator. It adds hidden doodads you can search for. This part is not very well made imo: your movement too slow to make running into all corners rewarding, and often it's not clear which visual elements block a route and which won't, so if you go exploring it will be just creeping in all directions and check if you bump against an obstacle or not. I even saw some hidden passages but couldn't bring myself to go there because I did not want to risk to waste time for a possible dead end. Sometimes it even happens that if you checka direction you'll get thrown right into a level which you've gotta complete (if you're unlucky: repeatedly) instead of just telling you: sry, no collectible for you hidden here. So I'ld recommend to avoid those collectibles (you won't find all at your first run anyway) and go with the flow.",

  "review": "[h1]TLDR:[/h1] \nIf you're really into art and sound design and you just want something to look at for a while that is minimally engaging and allows you a bit to explore (and I do mean a bit -- there's not too much to explore) then it's a good game. But otherwise, that's all this game is. No real mechanics, story, or engaging gameplay; it's just walking through pretty scenery.\n\n[h1]Disclaimer:[/h1] \n[strike]At this point I'm 3/4 of the way through the game.[/strike]\nI have now finished the game and my review still stands as it was. \n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1] \nThe Art is gorgeous, the sound design is excellent. \n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1] \nBut that's all this game really has to offer. \nThe puzzles aren't intelligent, they're just precise, the platforming is basic and all this game really requires of you is timing. The level design isn't great: there are lots of long expanses of just walking that seem like their only purpose is to allow you to view the scenery, or to fit other portions of the level in a logical way. It's just a lot of walking in between the occasional jumping puzzle. \n\n[h1]Meh:[/h1] \nThere is some story aspect told through the scenery and progression of the game, but it is very minimal and open to interpretation: it's just not compelling. I will applaud a good design aspect relating to the mechanics of the upgrades you receive. You don't need a tutorial, it's pretty straight forward by design. A simple button prompt and you understand the new stuff. Good design.\n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1] \nIt's gorgeous and sounds great. The mechanics, storytelling and puzzles are disappointing. \n\n[h1]6/10[/h1] \nIt offers some things to some people, but as a whole it's barely above average.",

  "review": "Below the unquestionable stunning visuals lies a mediocre platformer that wants to talk about serious issues but fails. But the focus on beauty first and gameplay and immersion second bogs down something that could have been great if only the same attention to detail would have been spend on the other parts of the game. The level design is unremarkable on a functional level, lots of narrow paths, walls that are indistinguishable from those you can pass through and many points of no return discourage exploration and break the flow a lot. The control is taken from the player frequently, even for something as simple as walking up some stairs, just so the game can make sure it looks the most beautiful it can and this always took me out of the moment.\n\nAnd the handled themes of loss, grief and depression are about as subtle as a Michael Bay movie. The game tries so hard to tell you how you should feel now with visuals and a very good soundtrack but does not put in the work to get you in the place (like Journey did) that it at times feels patronizing and kitschy.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is not a bad game. The visuals are a sight to behold and a new high bar for others. But that alone is not enough to reach the lofty goals the game tries to tackle. Would it be just about something like \"bringing back beauty to the world\" it would have been better for it but like this it feels like someone trying to talk about depression with no idea what to say so putting up a smoke screen of distracting visuals. \n\nAnd that is disappointing.",

Please just dont buy this game if i knew how bad it was you couldnt make me play it again if you gave it to me for free im sorry its just a bad game. It's really just an awful game. If you care that much to buy it please just look at a playthrough at 2.0x speed on YT or better yet just look at the steam trailer and move on cause all it is is pretty bland art that doesnt get better after youve seen the end of the game it just works up to that it just shitty compared to the end product.

While I was wowed by the fantastic graphics, sound design, and music, after finishing the game, I look back on it and I can't think of a single moment that I was having much fun while playing the game. In fact, it was rather tedious and dull at many moments throughout the game.\n\nGRIS doesn't have that much to offer in terms of gameplay, with it's main selling point being the narrative and the art. I am fine with games without much gameplay (I love To The Moon and Edith Finch), but these less gameplay focused games need to contain more presence from the story in order to keep players interested. GRIS does not do this. GRIS has the narrative pacing of a more gameplay focused game, meaning there are often large breaks in between narrative moments. However, with the minimal gameplay offered, this results in many long sections where nothing much is done but hold a few buttons to walk a long distance, maybe occasionally jumping. This is very dull and does not make a fun game to play.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 3/7, entirely carried by the visuals and music.",

It's a case study in how relatively minimalistic art style can be even more stunning and awe-striking than these games with next-gen 4K graphics. I found my jaw on the floor countless times during the short period of time I've played for. The use of color is fantastic. I was in love with the look of this game before I even made the decision to buy it.\n\nSoundtrack? Stunning as well. A perfect complement to the visuals.\n\nGameplay? Totally solid platformer. It's not any kind of crazy innovation in 2D platformers or anything like that, but it didn't need to be. Extremely well done nonetheless. This game isn't built for the hardcore player who wants a real challenge, but the puzzles are enough to keep you thinking without making you quit because you can't figure them out. You don't die.\n\nStory? Where do I start? There's clearly a narrative; the meaning of which I'm not quite able to put into words, and yet somehow it resonates so clearly in my head. You may just have to play it to understand what I'm talking about.\n\nI would recommend this game a million times over. This game is a job very well done.",

  "review": "Good god this game would have benefited from a sprint button. At least 50% of the [i]entire experience[/i] consists of holding D to get to the next interesting-looking scene, and since there is almost no gameplay whatsoever (and what gameplay there is usually feels mediocre and poorly explained) you're left in exasperating boredom as your character ambles across these ridiculously long and repetitive connector areas that can take up to 20 seconds or more to cross. It feels like they intentionally made controlling your character feel obtuse and sluggish so that you wouldn't blaze through the paper-thin platforming so quickly and would instead be forced to stare at the background for minutes on end- however the scenery is rather repetitive despite its beauty and so that activity quickly loses its luster. I didn't think the music was particularly engaging either; it's pleasant to listen to but only a couple pieces really wowed me at all. \n\nI'm really sick of artsy walking sims that don't actually understand what makes walking sims worth playing in the first place- engaging narratives and breathtaking scenery that never stops surprising and shocking you, either from humor or beauty or any number of emotional manipulations. GRIS has none of this; it's like a well-painted animation that goes on for 10x too long and has very little emotional meaning to convey beyond the obvious themes of loss. I don't usually like to directly compare games so as to belittle others, but I found myself wishing I was playing LIMBO or even INSIDE throughout my time in GRIS- those games do everything GRIS does far better, even the artistic elements are much more distinctive and intriguing than GRIS's pretty yet predictable landscapes. I get what GRIS's developers were going for but it's just so damn slow and uninteresting that it doesn't work. Fixing any one of the problems would instantly rejuvenate my interest in the game- making the puzzles actually interactive and entertaining, making the controls feel more fast-paced and fluid, or adding more prominent story elements- but as it stands it sits on the border of feeling empty and lifeless.",

  "review": "\"Game\" does not do this justice. \"Art\" does not give this justice. This was an emotional experience, a catharsis for me, I think after my own recent loss. I cried at a few points in this journey. Gris, this game with no words, no dialog, no text besides 'Press' indicating the button to press for your new dress ability when you obtain it, only symbolism, movement, beautiful watercolor and a truly moving soundtrack. I cried more in this short 2-3 hour experience than I have combined at Ori, which I've described repeatedly to friends as \"crying about owls.\"\n\nIf you've ever suffered grief, loss, depression, trauma, or even if you never have, please give this title a try. It's a beautiful experience that so eloquently encapsulates feelings without ever saying a word about them.",

I cannot recommend this game enough to be honest. \nPros:\nBeautiful, fantastic storytelling, the soundtrack is fabulous, the art is absolutely stunning and even the controls feel smooth and enjoybale. \nCons:\nIt's a really short game for the full price. Not that i regret paying it, because i really think the content of it is more than enough, but the playtime is just not overwhelming. The replayability also seems very limited to me.\n\nIn conclusion, the soundtrack alone would be enough for me to buy this game, and everything else is just an amazing bonus that keeps on giving! 10/10 really!",

The sound score sounds like one of those Netflix documentaries which tell very little and try to move people with annoying and unoriginal string crescendos.\nWhat is this girl doing? What is the black thing following her? Why are the statues and the girl crying? We are not told. Besides, the part where you would expect some action (e.g. the eel chasing you) are unplayable. No, I don't mean they are frustrating: you cannot play, you just have to watch the animated sequence and then start again jumping around and becoming a boulder.\nI am afraid the authors favored the cosmetic part instead of focusing on the gameplay; and as for the story, I think they stuck with good old appeal to emotions to mitigate the terrible effects of lack of ideas.",

The music is also very appropriate and the contextualisation is really good with no loops being apparent or any unnatural transitions. The ingame sound design is also excellent while being quite subtle, small things like footsteps sounding like a clock in an area denoted by an hour glass and ambient noise ducking out while under water.\nI went into this expecting a slightly boring but pretty walking sim but I was really surprised by the variety of nice gameplay. Progression is pretty perfect in how the gameplay evolves, it always feels good no matter what you're doing and the level design is consistently fun and engaging.\nI'm a big completionist so I spent a lot of time going the opposite direction from where I thought I was supposed to go but the nature of level design is super organic and eventually I found myself just wandering through it really so massive props for properly immersing me in that sense and making me forget I'm playing a game. And the good thing about collectibles is you can revisit chapters upon completion.\nThe story elements are also really charming and the little encounters you have are super memorable and lend themselves to clever gameplay evolution for a bit.\n\ntl;dr I really don't have anything to be critical about here, I can't think of any way it could be improved. I think everybody should try this, it's well worth full price, probably the prettiest game I've ever played and it's an excellent example of games as an art form, 10/10",

Yeah, you could say gris is kinda short, but in those 3-4 hours youll have the most chills you will ever have in your life. Although Gris is amazing, it is not for everyone, it is a slow-paced game and if you are a shoot n explosions kind of guy, dont buy it, you will get bored. If i would have to say something bad about this game it would be the fact that sometimes you will get confused by things in the background and think they are platforms, and vice versa.

It is self doubt. It is worry. It is remorse and regret. It is so many things that can\u2019t be washed away by standing still and finding calm\n\nGris is a game that wants to teach us something about these fears we hold inside. It does so with a perfect art style, a moving soundscape, and gameplay that, at times, flashes over into metaphor\n\nAn masterpiece in which few have managed to do/achieve and even fewer to reach me the way Gris did, to this day\nOne of the most breath taking, stunning, out of this world experience I've ever experienced on my whole life\n10/10",

It's not even close. \n\nAlong with the art style, Nomada Studio manages to tell a story without any words being said in the entire game. The scenery, colors, and music of the game tell the story beautifully, which brings up another point.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal! Every minute of the game has perfect background audio. I don't know of another game that combines a soundtrack with gameplay so perfectly.\n\nI plan on playing this game again, and there are very few games I have played that are worth multiple playthroughs.

  "review": "[h1]Gris is the first game that has ever drove me to write a review because it is not just a game but also a marvelous piece of art.[/h1]\n\n[b]G[/b]ris's story can be interpreted in different ways to different people, but in my imagination, it is a a very beautiful story about someone who is dealing with loss, who is giving her best to fight back against the harshness of the world and has started to lose hope in life. In her adventures, everything you see has a deeper meaning and can be translated to actions and events that you can see in the real world. You can also immerse yourself in the game and truly experience the stages of grieving which has been beautifully portrayed by the game as Gris goes through subtle landscape changes, music, actions and even from the color of the world. \n\n[b]R[/b]epresenting someone who likes to stay happy and think positively, this game has been a reality check for me. There are things that you can prevent from happening but sometimes, there are things that you just can't control... No matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you cry, no matter how hard you fight, and no matter strong you are, the world can just sweep you right off your leg. However, Gris has also shown me another important thing. Even when things have been too tough on you, you must always muster up the courage to fight back and face your demon. Because it is not the world you must overcome, you must overcome yourself. Only then, you can truly see how colorful the world is. Only when say goodbye to your sad memories will you open up space to allow joy back into your life. While the world can be sorrowful at some point, there is also happiness and color to be found if you look hard enough for it. \n\n[b]I[/b]n my opinion, the world is a very beautiful place to live in. Life goes up and down and all around and it is full of surprises, happy memories to be made, sad memories to forget, but at the end of the day, you are just writing another beautiful story like the game Gris. Every action you take may not have a big impact on you now, but it may have a pro-founding effect for yourself in the future or to others who genuinely care and concern about you so I beg of you to write yourself and to others the most elegant story for us to read and experience.\n\n[h1]TL/DR[/h1]\n\n[b]S[/b]o this is Gris, a unique and very beautiful story game which everyone could learn from and take in as experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to you because I have really enjoyed this game as I could relate to the main character and I want to share this experience to other people here who may also have experienced loss, depression or sorrow and has picked themselves back up in their lives. However, I will not recommend this game to you if you are someone who doesn't like sad thoughts at 4AM in the morning as the game may touch you in spots which are too close to home. I admit, I have cried upon finishing the game and suffered insomnia but even if you are weak-hearted... I will still recommend this game to you.",

The gameplay itself is so simple but the way it's brought about into play makes it satisfying and gives you so many AHA! moments. \nBut more than that, Gris really makes you feel and think and imagine what emotional journey the character is going through all without a lick of dialogue. To be fair though, the music does half the work alongside the visuals. A MUST PLAY if you haven't already.\nI'm still going through the game again [because I'm a completionist] although I finished it because there are so many little gestures and thoughts that you miss otherwise and its such a wonderful feeling to piece together and understand everything that is going on from start to finish. And I refuse to go through a walkthrough because I refuse to sully my gameplay by discovering what someone else already did. The first time I've felt that for any game.\nI cried a few times too. and this is DESPITE the fact that I knew EXACTLY how the game was going to end. I mean, you do figure out the plot midway, and you have these cute moments and you reach the end and you're like. Yup, knew this was going to end exactly this way.

I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing or at least the bare minimum. Definitely try to get a brief idea for the game to understand it better but for sure going in spoiler-free is a much better and interesting experience overall~\n\nThere's something a certain sound in the music reminds me of that I can't quite put my finger on, but I'll figure it out one day.\n\nOther than that I highly recommend this game just as much as everyone else, its really enjoyable and well worth the price even without the discount.",

Well, this is it.\n\nThe game revolves around a girl who hit rock bottom, unable to use her voice, her world began to dim. Mustering her own strength, she set out on a journey to discover new abilities, and slowly rebuild her world with the use of color.\n\nDeveloped by a small team named Nomada Studio, their passion is seen through artistic backgrounds present in-game, with hair-raising music that truly absorbed me on my playthrough, while not forgetting the very essence of a game - challenging levels. But fear not, as the game does not portray any form of death, and the violence present in this game is just the fear that hinders us from change. GRIS fully lets the player explore the world, with little to none usage of texts for an immersive experience.\n\nFrom complex levels, plot tackling our inner struggles, thrilling soundtracks, fascinating characters, and of course, the stunning and aesthetic world of GRIS, this game truly did well on these kind of things that it leaves no room for flaws for a game made by a small team. \n\nThis is a one whole new experience, and I fully recommend this game to anyone of all ages and genders. I can proudly say this is worth my penny, despite indulging myself into this for only 5 hours. \n\nSo to the developers of this game, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this wonderful experience.\n\n\n",

I didnt feel connected to the story in anyway and simply continued to the end to complete it (Maybe because i took a break from the game and then came back to finish it).\n\nThe game includes extras and allows you to revisit areas to collect extras but i personally wont be investing the time to do that.\n\nAs it stands i can only recommend this game from a visual art perspective and if you love art style games and enjoying a journey through that environment then this is for you.  \n\nIf however you prefer a captivating story and decent puzzle platforming then this isnt for you.\n\n",

  "review": "to begin with the obvious: this game is absolutly beautiful!!\n it has a very unique artstyle, created by some former ubisoft employees in cooperation with the spanish painter Conrad Roset.\nthe games title GRIS means grey in spanish and is also the name of the protagonist.\nGRIS is also not just a gorgeous looking walking simulator, like some - including myself - may think. it\u00b4s more a relaxing platformer with light puzzle elements.\n\n1: The graphics:\nlike i already said: the artstyle is beautiful! every frame is a handpainted aquarel put into motion. \nfirst everything is just white to black and shades of grey, but after every part of the game another color -related to the current stage -  is added to the world.\nalso the animations are fluid.\noverall the artstyle fits the games theme perfectly\n10/10\n\n2: The sound:\nthe score created by spanish composers Berlinist ranges from dreamy and relaxing tho sometimes haunting.\nfrom violins to piano sounds to sometimes more electronic style torwards the end. a good artstyle is not as effective without good music, and these guys nailed it!\nalso there is no voice acting in this game since it\u00b4s completely without dialoge.\n10/10\n\n3: The gameplay\nthe main focus of this game is getting immersed into the world and feel the atmosphere. \nso in order to not get thrown out of this, there is no real threat in this game. the platforming is mostly very easy and there is no way to die. the controls are simple: left, right, jump and transforming your dress into a block to smash things or withstand storms and such.\nafter every stage you get a new abillity related to the current phase the protagonist is in.\nso overall the gameplay fits, but there could have been more puzzles and maybe some more abillities\n8/10\n\n4: The story:\nGRIS doesnt tell a traditional told story with dialoge. it\u00b4s all told via the environment and colors.\nbut from what i think, you play as a young woman called gris, who has lost her mother and is now trying to deal with this loss.\nevery part of the game represents one of the 5 phases of grief with color and movement: denial with white and black, anger with red, bargaining with green, depression with blue and acceptance with yellow.\nbut there is a lot of room for interpretations, since everyone could experience the journey a bit different.\n9/10\n\n5: The verdict:\nGRIS is an audio visual piece of art! it\u00b4s very atmospheric and touching if you let it.\nbut you have to immerse yourself into the world and the protagonists journey to overcome her fears and grief.\nif you can manage that, you will get a wonderful experience no book, movie or any other medium could possibly give you!\nit is a wonderful game like no other!\n\nif you want a fast, action focused, ultra realistic looking game, this is obviously not for you.\nfor everyone else i could not recommend this enough!\nit may not seem like it\u00b4s worth the price for the quite short experience, but it definitly is!\ndo yourself a favour and give GRIS a chance!\nit will be absolutly worth it!\n\n10/10\n\n\n\n",

  "review": "GRIS is a short artistic platforming game. It's worth the purchase during this sale. Personally, I love the aesthetics of this game. But I do find the game to be frustrating in some parts. The platforming can be clunky sometimes, and the character moves really, really slow. \n\nStill, it's worth the experience. Definitely a must-purchase during the sales.",

I appreciate the people that put their heart into this piece of art. I would also recommend to check out the EXTRA part to see how it all comes together. My favorite is the little robot looking character that eats apples.\nKudos to my boyfriend for introducing this game to me and his patient watching me struggle with the movements : )",
