  "review": "It's funny how I took this long to jump on the [i]Hades[/i] train. This game and I are a perfect match. Oh well, hindsight is 20/20.\n\nFor the purpose of being as helpful as possible, I'm going to put my criticism first. Even with the wide variety of weapons and aspects to choose from, the combat loop does get fairly repetitive after a point. There's a LOT of grinding to do, which may wear on the nerves once you figure out how to clear a run consistently. The voice acting is merely so-so 90% of the time. And the fishing minigame is the same one that it seems like EVERY non-fishing game uses: wait for the bobber to splash, then react as quickly as possible to reel the fish in. None of these make a bad game, of course - in my opinion, they're all small nitpicks compared to the good stuff that [i]Hades[/i] has on offer.\n\nThe strongest element on display in a run is [i]strategy.[/i] From before the run begins, to every chamber up until the final boss, you are constantly making decisions about the next step of your power growth. Should you prioritize raw damage or debuffs? Is max health worth more than some permanent currency? Should you take the easy room for a small boost, or the hard room for a large boost? Can you afford some HP loss and a debuff for a potentially game-breaking powerup in the near future? All of these and more are questions you will ask yourself constantly throughout each and every run. It's wildly experimental at first, but with maturing experience and personal preference you should eventually figure out the stuff that works best.\n\nThe really genius part of this is how the game gives you incentives to try everything at least once: the Dark Thirst mechanic gives you a bonus to permanent currency for using whichever weapon it's attached to, and Prophecies reward you for reaching certain in-game milestones such as \"use every boon that Zeus can offer\" or \"reach the final boss with such-and-such weapon aspect.\" I found lots of fun and unexpectedly strong combinations just from doing those things. No two runs are completely identical, and much of the fun in [i]Hades[/i] comes from embracing the chaos.\n\nBeyond that, this game is just OOZING with style and personality. With a clever combination of 3D character models and 2D environment art, the game pulls off a flawless isometric style which isn't too stressful on modern systems. Everything on display here looks really good, but the real stars of the show are the character portraits. Even if they're only on screen for a few seconds during dialogue, these portraits are so detailed and charismatic that they're almost lifelike. The main character Zagreus, in particular, has a few different portraits depending on his mood as he speaks. It's a small detail in the grand scheme of things, but I find it charming nonetheless.\n\nAs for the story, it's not overly complicated: Zagreus wants to escape from the underworld, and he has to fight through his father Hades's forces in order to do so. Individual character motivations make things more interesting than what's on the surface, but what really makes this one something special is how it's tied to the gameplay. [i]Hades[/i] is a roguelike (rogue[i]lite[/i] if we're being technical), so you're going to die a lot. But rather than being a hard reset, each death advances the story a little bit. The fact that you're dying repeatedly is no secret to anyone back at home. The characters there will often have something new to say about your situation, offering advice or encouragement. You'll even get the chance to open up some character-specific plotlines and sidequests once you interact with everyone enough. For me personally, this actually went a LONG way in keeping things from getting frustrating early on - death moves you forward, and in a meaningful way to boot.\n\nI could go on, but I think those are the main points to cover. [i]Hades[/i] is top-notch, and I can't recommend it enough.",

First off I thought the super complicated art style did not mesh well with a roguelike at all, and yet everyone adores this game so I figured I would give it a chance. It does not mesh. On top of that despite a ludicrous amount of depth, progression is so painfully slow that it feels like saving pennies to pay for a ferarri! Lastly, the enemies, movement, attacking, and progression are all convoluted and inobvious, and the story is intricate but moves at a slog! I am going to keep grinding for another 5 hours probably just to see, but if this does not pick up it feels like a huge loss.",

  "review": "Hades is an excellent game, and I understand why it won so many awards. It hits most of the foundations of the action genre mechanically, and really works well in its isometric angle. The best part, however, is that its artstyle and ideas are so good; blending brilliant colours and personality with a sophisticated and whimsical mythological setting. For anyone else using Greek gods, the underworld, and the like; Hades shows them how to do it perfectly, so that it feels like an original world but still has familiar concepts. \n\nCompared with other \"rogue-like\" games, Hades is fairly easy and brings about some new mechanics in having permanent progression and generally standard weaponry. Runs aren't as different as in a game like Dead Cells where minor changes to your attack severely impact you, and most of the variation is built on status effects and boosting damage. You can change your weapon abilities marginally, and they have good move-sets, but there is still only six of them. Hades' trials can be done in about 20-30 minutes on average, so the game is focused on beating it repeatedly on streaks, or upping statistics to change the difficulty; while you get rewarded with customization for your base and more story. \n\nFollowing the mention of how good the mythological setting is, all the characters and the plot are phenomenal. Everybody in this game is insanely likeable, the protagonist perhaps best of all, and you'll really feel motivated to uncover what's going on and see what people have to talk about. It only makes you wish there was even more, since conversations are so short between the blood-pumping gameplay. All the while, there's also pretty good music in the background, which I didn't think would be good upon starting up and seeing trailers; but which was absolutely superb.\n\nThe only real flaw with Hades is that it's functionally \"short.\" There's only four different templates, and you'll very quickly start recognizing room layouts. There's also a pathetic amount of boss enemies; only about four with very minor variations between them, and almost no support from mini-bosses (some zones like Elysium only really having one miniboss at all). Beating the game is done pretty early, but you do subsequent runs for the true ending and epilogue, and it does become slightly monotonous because even while the gameplay is good its always the same levels. There's no real diversity to its roguelike level design, and it doesn't feel generated through procedures, but through copy and pasting. Since everything is contained only in rooms, there's also no exploration mechanics at all, just buffs and combat, followed by bosses. Without the higher difficulty settings, it would be extremely boring, and even then, I don't think the customization for ability is good enough to warrant infinite replayability. Every upgrade and skill you receive is essentially just a percentage stat boost to damage, sometimes giving status effects like cumulative damage or slow-down. You end up becoming quite skilled with just the weapon in general, and every bonus through the levels does nothing to challenge you on that front. All in all, the game's scope of customization could have been larger to make it feel like a new experience. \n\nStill, I highly recommend it just a singleplayer game, since it really puts games like Diablo to shame. It's worth it just for the first 5-10 playthroughs, and how much fun it is to watch yourself improve enough to escape the underworld.",

  "review": "Tl;dr: This game is one of the best rogue-likes I've ever played, but one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nOk, if you want to read a full review, here we go.\nIt seems everyone is heaping on the praise for this game, be it Charlie of Penquinz0 or even the Game Awards, and for good reason. This game is one of the most well-designed, fun, engaging and challenging games I've played, and I honestly can't praise it enough.\n\nThe game's basic plot goes as thus: you play as Zagreus, son of Hades and Prince of the Underworld, as you try desperately to escape your fathers realm with the aid of the Gods of Olympus. Along the way you'll meet other characters from Greek Mythology, battle deadly monsters from the Underworld and explore the ever-changing, maze-like layout of the  four areas, while withstanding your fathers' best attempts to stop you.\n\nThe game is a top-down Rogue-like with a beautiful art-style and all the basic requirements for a rogue-like. You start with nothing and gradually get more powerful with every room you clear. Whether it's boons from the Gods which give you a piece of their power, hammers created by the Greek legend Daedalus that imbue your weapon with new qualities, or gold to buy perks from the Underworld Salesman Charon, the game has a nice sense of scaling. It feels great to get a build that synergises perfectly, but it'll take a little while through the run to do that. When you die you lose everything and are whisked back to the start to try again. Rinse and repeat. While at first sounding methodical and boring, each run is vastly different with the powers you get, monsters you kill, characters you meet and rewards you win. It's a fantastic feeling to inch ever closer to prevailing, and euphoric when you overcome the challenges of your father for the first time\n\nSo Hades works well enough as a rogue-like, big deal. But honestly that's not where it's strength lies. It's greatest strength is the way it delivers its story and the relationships you make with the characters. Every time you talk to a character, be it denizen of the Underworld or God of Olympus, you learn a bit more about them and their relationships. You can get closer to characters you choose to get close to, even receiving gifts from them if you decide to honour them with nectar obtained during runs. The dialogue and the interactions these characters have with Zagreus are fun and oozing with character and wit, with Zeus acting almighty, kingly and fatherly, Poseidon playing the role of the laid-back Uncle and Hermes the fast-talking delivery boy just to name a few. Every conversation has its own charm and it's incredibly fun to wade through the dialogue.\n\nBut not everything you get in the dungeons is wasted. You can use Darkness in the Mirror you have in your bedroom to gain permanent buffs to your character, Gemstones at the builder to create new rooms you can come across in runs among other things, and the aforementioned nectar to strengthen your relationship with the characters. These items make every failed run feel worth it as you can come back stronger than before, not just with knowledge but also new powers. (Invest in Death Defiance asap, trust me)\n\nPros: Fantastic visual style, engaging, strategic and fast-paced gameplay that runs smooth as polished wood, charming characters soaking with personality, a challenge that's noticeable but not insurmountable, engaging storyline, fantastic soundtrack composed by Darren Korb, and the ability to pet Cerberus the three-headed doggo\n\nCons: While it doesn't bother me, in order to unlock everything of the main story you will need to complete a lot of runs, which could be a possible turn off for potential players\n\nSo to end, Hades is a brilliant game and a recommendation not only to lovers of Rogue-likes but gamers in general. There's something to love about Hades for everyone.\n\nMy rating: 9.5/10",

  "review": "10/10. 10/10. 10/10. Holy shit, this game is basically perfect in every way. I'm having an incredibly difficult time finding faults here, and usually that's easy for me, even for my favorite games of all time. Hades just sorta showed up and sat itself down in the Top 5 almost overnight.\n\nI have NEVER seen a game with *this* level of polish and effort put into every. single. detail. Even the in-game patch notes automatically censor references to things you haven't discovered yet! Just... what the fuck. That is true dedication to the craft. All the awards this game has earned are well-deserved.\n\n> Art direction: visuals, sounds, music, the style of everything... all top-notch.\n\n> Build quality: responsiveness and feel of combat, and even the UI both in and out of fights, is just right. If you've heard of a game being described as \"juicy\" before, where even stuff like clicking on menu items just *feels* good, this game is the Platonic ideal of that concept. Jank? What jank? This is a VIDEO GAME with NO JANK. WHAT. HOW??\n\n> Performance: buttery smooth at all times, with not even the slightest hint of a FPS dip anywhere to be found on my 9-year-old PC (albeit with a 5-year-old GPU) running at 1080p. Same experience with both DirectX and Vulkan. Controls are easy to set up and everything feels great using keyboard / mouse. I'm sure it's fine on a gamepad if that's your preference.\n\n> Story and writing: lots of [good, at times subtle] humor, wholesomeness, hooks to keep you interested and invested, fantastic character personalities... and on top of that, everything is always well-written and with best-in-class voice acting. I haven't even seen any misuses of \"its/it's\" and little bloopers like those sometimes show up in even the most well-written titles. Not here! This one is also loaded with puns. *Good* puns.\n\nThere's also hardly any dialogue repetition for even the most common of game events. There's an insane amount of unique, 100% voiced dialogue and context-based remarks from different characters on even the simplest, subtlest of things. They thought of EVERYTHING. I've only noticed a few lines that felt slightly behind on context (like a character noting you've been to X recently when you've already been to Y and Z beyond that), but it all sounds so natural. Localization must have been a nightmare if they translated it all with the same standards they applied to the rest of the game.\n\n> Gameplay: FUN. REALLY FUN! All the polish in the world wouldn't matter if it was boring or tedious to play. Nope, this one is a blast basically at all times. The polish just makes it that much more enjoyable. The game is very good at self-teaching, and it both encourages and rewards experimentation. It makes even failed runs contribute to your overall progression in both the game and the running narrative.\n\nBut the best part of all? The inverse bell curve difficulty. The game starts out HARD, but still fun and encouraging to play. Over time, as you gain upgrades and experience, it gets easier... until the point where you finally complete a successful run and feel fantastic, only to come back down and find a WHOLE NEW SLEW of entirely optional challenges to make the game start getting harder again. You'll never wind up bored unless you never branch out and try different things. I could see myself playing this one for a decade without having ticked off every box in the challenge settings, god damn. Replay value is through the roof.\n\nMods??? Does this game have mod support? Does it even need them? I honestly don't know, and for probably the first time ever, I don't even care. The game itself is already akin to some lunatic's passion project mod that's been in development for 15 years, only with stratospheric production values. Someone will probably figure it out one day if it's not viable right now, too.\n\nIf there's anything I can criticize here, it's that maybe some parts of the UI are a bit busy and hard to figure out at first, but that's what happens when you have a game with SO MUCH CONTENT MY GOD IT'S BURSTING AT THE SEAMS. Oh, and it would be cool to have more hellpupper-petting animations.\n\nIf you think you'll at all enjoy the gameplay, get this one. You won't be disappointed. This game is an absolute masterwork and I'm still just staggered. I hadn't even heard of it until a few weeks ago and then blam, oh hello there god-tier game I'll be replaying for life! Nice to see you! What a gem.",

Hades somehow made me look forward to starting over so much I'd sometimes start thinking about how I couldn't wait to die so I could progress with the story/relationships/power ups.  I have no idea how Supergiant pulled that off but they did, and I feel like it's a miracle.  \n\nThe combat is basically perfect.  I found myself compulsively moving forward not wanting to stop because the combat is so much fun I had to force myself to stop playing so I could sleep.  This game is a masterpiece.

On top of that, the story is integrated so seamlessly into the gameplay that it is the perfect respite between bouts so you keep coming and going for more. And the soundtrack, by Hades himself, Darren Korb knocked it right out of the park; even better than Bastion's!

Hades has been known to be \"The rogue-like for people who don't like rogue-likes\", each time you restart, you unlock more story and make minor ability and weapon progression so that 90% of the time, your next run will be ever so mildly easier. There are lots of random encounters in the game too and the characters and story are all so well-made. Also the gameplay feels like Doom Eternal if Doom Eternal was a badass rogue-like rpg (and Doom Eternal is already badass). My heart was racing so fast at some points that I was scared I was gonna pass out. The music is absolutely fire and it adds to the experience perfectly.

However, if your trigger fingers ain't up to the code, Hades offers you an \"easy-mode\", whereby each time you die you become stronger.\n\nSoundtrack is wonderfully gloomy while chipper at the same time, and the vocals, sung by Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett, are top-dinky as ever. Tonnes of voice-lines from the entire cast.\n\nAnyway this game is great, it won a few hundred million game awards, and for good reason. If you're into rogue-lites, a sexy Greek Pantheon, and petting dogs, Hades will be up your alley. Do remember. however:\n\nThere is no escape.",

This game is perfect for anyone itching for the horde type gameplay of an ARPG and the fast but thoughtful runs of a roguelike.\n\nI've played around 400 hours, 100%'d it and I still find myself going back when I feel the urge to have some hard and fast gameplay. 10/10 would recommend",

The two components that stood out for me the best is the lore of the game and the multi weapon option.\n\nThe lore is rooted in Greek mythology, the are a few deviations from the original tales, though these are merely to make the story line more be fitting of a video game. I personally love Greek mythology and this was a fun way of learning more about it. On top of that, the fact that you can develop relationships with the NPCs as well as have choices that impact that relationship.\n\nAs for the multi weapon, each weapon has there own upgrades and allows for any form of game play.

Great music (special thanks to Darren Korb), great art style, great story, great gameplay, great design everything is amazing and well thought.

  "review": "Hades is a nice introductive roguelite game for people who new to genre, even veterans of rogulike games would appreciate strong aspects of Hades. Art direction, style, concept and voice acting are high quality, far better than what you expect from a indie game. Gameplay and combat is pretty solid but repetitive when it comes to boons and tactics so it's very easy to get bored after 10-14 hours which is not much time for a roguelite game. Especially boss fights may become very boring after first or second escape from dungeon because you already know the attacks of the bosses and it's just become button mashing. \nHades is more solid and polished than most recent AAA games, It has very strong aspects but I got tired and bored after 15 hour. You might enjoy the game longer hours so give it a try.",

It has a really interesting story pacing, which both ramps up and finishes very slowly compared to most other games, and is almost entirely dependent on dialouge and character development so DON'T SKIP THE DIALOUGE if you want to enjoy the story. \n\nTo be honest though you can enjoy the game itself without understanding the story at all, in fact it's the type of gameplay that might make it hard to stop playing if you get stuck at some point, and time really flies by in that case. I put in 10-12 hours on both my first two days playing, kind of on accident.\n\nIf you're going for achievements these are all very reasonable; but beware that some of the more difficult ones not only takes \"absurd amounts of easy grinding\" as they sometimes do in other games, but also at least some level of mechanical skill (enough to complete the game on a higher difficulty level). 80ish hours are probably reasonable for 100% achievements and a thoroughly enjoyed storyline.",

Yeah you can do that.\n\nWant to play slow with a high damage ranged weapon? You got it. \n\nWant to use a mix of melee and ranged attacks? Sure thing. \n\nThere's so many interesting power-ups and different weapons that even after all the time I've spent playing I still regularly find combinations of upgrades and abilities that work effectively. Sometimes certain upgrades that I thought were pretty weak on their own become overwhelmingly powerful when combined with another upgrade. \n\nEvery aspect of this game is satisfying and rewarding, and I truly think that anyone could pick this game up and have a blast playing it.

Original research made me jump to the conclusion that the game would be \"too easy\" and that I wouldn't enjoy the game.\n\nHowever I still decided to get this game due to the many many many positive reviews.\n\nI do not regret the choice at all. The combat flows and varies between runs. Every run will be different, due to the randomness of the power ups. The soundtrack is excellent as well. Every time I start a run, the soundtrack just hypes you up to play this game. The art style is also amazing and the story is actually good. Never thought a rogue like could have a story like this but Hades pulls it off. \n\nIf you have doubts getting this game, but want to play it, I suggest to purchase it.

And the interaction with NPCs lets you learn more about the world and the people within it. \nFor me the strongest aspect was the short runs, around 45 min at the beginning when you need to learn the game and look at everything, later the run is going down to around 25 min. So when you die/fail your lost isnt as hard as in other rogue-like games. This lets you have more fun with the game while you are trying to beat it instead of getting angry/frustrated.\n\nI hope you will have as much fun with Hades as i had. Good luck",

  "review": "This game is very good. The core gameplay is very enjoyable, the music and visuals are amazing, and the storytelling is fantastic. However, there are some issues with the game.\n\nThe first is the progression system. This game feels like it is less about getting better at the game, and more about just unlocking all of your mirror abilities. The main issue is Death Defiant, which is an absolutely terrible concept that should never be in any roguelike that is supposed to have any element of skill. The other abilities are also offenders, but none to nearly the same extent.\n\nThe other issue is the post-game replayability. The heat system is really, really not fun. Whereas something like Nuclear Throne has an infinite dungeon that adds \"postgame\" content, Hades has the same runs with terrible and unfun modifiers added on. \n\nI think what this game does well is amazing. The game had potential to be the greatest roguelike ever, if they had just taken a page from Nuclear Throne or Issac as far as replayability or progression goes. Still worth your time and money and is a great game, just dont go in expecting the greatest game ever.",

But I adore Greek mythology and couldn't resist buying Hades for all the lore and story, thinking I could always use a trainer/mod to get through it if absolutely necessary. It hasn't been necessary! :O\n\nIt's taken me a lot more attempts than many people, and I almost maxed out God Mode...but I finally escaped. By myself! Usually I'm way too massively frustrated by dying in games - and I die a lot as I'm not that skilled, lol - and will abandon them in a heartbeat, but there's something about the balance in Hades that's just *chef's kiss* perfect. It never feels unfair, and the 'just one more go...' vibe is STRONG. \n\nAll in all I love it more than I ever expected to, and urge you to try it - even if you think you wouldn't be any good at it. You might just surprise yourself like I did. :)",

I only have 40 hours on this game and it might be one of my favorites of all time. Its a 10/10 (out of 100 rating at the end for a more precise rating, as well as each category rating) and you should buy the game even if rouge like games aren't your type, please allow me to embellish below (slight spoilers, nothing about overall game).\n\nThe Story:\n\nThe story is beautifully done and has amazing pacing. The perfect blend of Greek Mythology and family. The gods, immortals and damned souls you meet only enrich the story to the near perfect limit. The dialogue and the line delivery from the voice actors can both be the most cheerful or bone chilling that I have heard. I am reaching the end of the story but I felt the need to express my love for the game here and I may update the rating once I'm done. I wish I could express more but I wouldn't want to spoil anything for the new players out their or even tempt them to peak so that they can experience everything firsthand. (10/10)\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nThis game can be very fast paced and the style of both the fighting and the characters can be put no other way than beautiful. The more you play and run through the game the more weapons you unlock and you can continue to upgrade them to make you play-style more clean. The various boons that the gods gift you change your run every time and can make or break a run. I only wish that there were a few more weapons to play with but the 6 that you can use have amazing gameplay and may force you out of your comfort zone as you need to change how you play. The bosses are amazing, hands down some of the best I have had the please of beating in all of my gaming history. I won't mention any names but they are all from Greek mythology and have perfectly captured their characters if they were real people with emotions and feelings. Each of them are amazing and the final boss fight is beautiful especially  when coupled with the games music. (9/10)\n\nThe Music (Some tracks mentioned contain spoilers:\n\nOne thing to get out of the way, HOLY S**T! This game's music is downright eargasmic. The game music blends music inspired from ancient Greece and heavy metal. It sounds strange but just listening to the main menu music for the first time was amazing. I knew that I was going to enjoy every second of the sound track. One of my favorite tracks is The Unseen Ones, Darren Korb plays the guitar in that song like it owes him money. I don't recommend listening to all of the music until playing through the game at least once to avoid music spoilers.  The soundtrack is free on Spotify but I still felt the need to buy it on steam just to support SUPERGIANT Games. Other great tracks that I want to recommend are The King and the Bull and God of the Dead. Ever since buying the game I have been obsessed with the soundtrack. (10/10)\n\nOverall:\n\nJust please buy this game, if you have less than 2 hours on it you can return it within 2 weeks with your money back. Even if just to try it. Current owners say what you like but it is a masterpiece in my eyes. (98/100)",

  "review": "Really interesting take on the rogue-like gerne. I like how they implemented a story and conversations in there and how they made the rogue-like feel like a part of the story instead of a gerne.\nHowever, this also ment that a lot of conversation take place at the end of every game (or attempt at a run).\nThis means I canto go trough all the conversation that I need to progress side-quest storylines etc.\nI've defeated Hades after lil over 20 attempts and completed the game (spoler alert) in a lil over 30 attempts.\nAfter that, I cuidded around 20 games in a row to finish all the side-quest conversations, unlock new weapons and other stuff.\nI had all the requirements to unlock it already, but in my 20 attempts I got all the main story dialogue, so they dont feed me the side-quest dialogue.\n\nSpoiler alert 2: After around 15 runs I killed Charon. After my 40th game, some1 congratiolates me with beating him (that is like 20 hours further in gameplay time). Those things kinda get me out of the story.\nI read here most people beat the boss after 30-40 games, so I was probs faster than intended, but I didnt even use the GOD mode (easy setting). That wouldve really messed up the main story.\n\nAnd after you finally beat him 1 time, you have to grind out 10 more, before the official ending.\nAnd then you get some side-quests and kindoff mainquest story, which is a huuuuge grind, which eventually made me just quit after beating the game like 30 times. Left me feeling a little weird.\n\nAll and all a very good game, with its ups and downs. I give the main game (untill beating the boss 1 time) a 8,5. I give beating it completely after the 10th kill a 8,0. I give the endgame a 7/10, pretty grindy and non that interesting. \n\nSo I guess that makes this game a 8/10 overall, still pretty good. Would recomming. When in doubt, buy in sale. If you like rogue-likes, 100% recommend out of sale also.",

Clarity for example, instead of the TBOI bullshit item description that is most of the time a useless reference, Hades states exactly how each skill works complete with the numbers, so, no need to have the wiki open for this one. \nThe story, soundtrack, dubbing and visuals are an outstanding work, no rogue like that I've played even comes close to it. Unfortunately, most random elements are cut out to fit the narratives in. So, you'll always follow a preset number of enemy encounters with preset rooms, and a preset number of items and some weapon modifiers. This makes multiple runs increasingly uninteresting. Thing is at 42 hours, having gone way past the ending, I am nowhere near the epilogue because it demands a lot of your time. So, a good chunk of the really good story I'll never experience because I'm just not eager to go to another \"timing square on the bow over the same levels again and again\" section. \nBut, the experience until completing the game is really good, and I assure you'll have some 30 hours of solid fun.",

[/b]\nWIP\nPros:\n- great visual elements\n- nice combat system, familiar to Bastion, with some improvements\n- very good skill design, kinda like Asian online games with colorful and eye-catching skills\n- have the god mode that starts with 20%, and +2% per lose run, 80% max; although can be better by adding a custom input field to let users to customize the value as they see fit\n- the narrator that also narrated Bastion\nCons:\n- no mod supports\n- rogue-like game style, each run took around 15-30 mins, heavily RNG based\n- resources per run is like bare minimum like a fucking joke, just use cheats for resources farming\n- too much ramblings and excessive dialogues, if i want to hear people speak, i will watch a movie, not playing a video game, and there are no skip mechanisms (no, space hitting is not enough, that is how much dialogues they have)\n- can not customize playing experience, aka random skills/boons, complicated skills/boons combos with each gods, just give users the choice to pick what they fucking want, then add a HEAT with random skills/boons.\n- completing missions/prophecies is also based on RNG, you must can interact with NPC 1 TIME/run, and with each NPC having thousands of rambling bullshits, you gonna need some luck until they talk about the things you wanna hear, also many runs you do not even have a chance to see them, and on top of that, NPC will also going on and on about trivial shit that you give no fucks even when in the middle of a quest\n- items unlocking is also a fucking joke, weapons unlocking based on NPC chat (good luck unlocking the gauntlet), fishing like 1~2 times per run (and you can only get access to a skill that increase fishing spot appear chance after half the run)\n- \"learn more by deepening your relationship with X\" aka go to wiki to see how to unlock the fucking relationship tree, while they ask you to slay a stupid mob for 100 times to add 1 page about that mob, that you can also see it in a wiki -> 1 prime examples of useless texts filling the whole \n\nPersonal problems:\n- fishing: just study fishing in Stardew Valley, not everyone has 1 second reflex with masochist tendencies to fish with % based for legendary fish (combines with1~2 fishing spots/run\n- start hacking when go to lv 4, very \"nice\" poison mechanics, and when you reach the antidote fountain, you already lose +100 hp and the poison is gone already, like the fountain existed only to mock players\n- show the required encounters left when hover a keepsakes using the Boon Info menu\n- Nyx better mother",

My favourite being the Extreme Measures which unlocks what I feel to be the true versions of each boss fight.

Don't let me stop you.\"\n\nWhat can I say about Hades that can\u2019t already be said? The answer is not much, so I\u2019ll keep the review brief. Hades is a roguelite Hack and Slasher in which you play as the demigod Zagreus, who after coming of age (For the past hundred years) decides he\u2019s sick of the drab and dank underworld and would much rather live it up on the surface. The only problem is, his dad is the titular character, and he made it very clear that Zagreus will get up there over his dead body\u2026. literally. Yours\u2019s too as well. The Greek God\u2019s are immortal, and although they can be killed, they just respawn back in the Underworld. So, after death after death slaying legions of Hade\u2019s monsters, Zagreus has convinced himself to make the trip. Maybe the journey will provide him some answers about the nature of his birth\u2026. Maybe there is something up there that he\u2019d be better off not knowing?\nCombat is solid. It offers a variety of different weapons for Zagreus to use, with their own strengths and weaknesses. I really took a liking to the bow, while for your first few attempts the shield may be a better starter choice. In addition to your weapons, you gain boons, or enhancements from the rest of the Olympian family who sympathize with your plight. The boons have a variety of effects depending on the God, such as Poseidon blowing enemies away in a tidal wave, Demeter slowing enemies down with ice, Artemis increasing your crit rate or allowing you to shoot smart arrows, Aphrodite being able to charm enemies, etc. the game has a decent, though lacking a bit variety of enemies, but in general, though the gameplay is solid, it\u2019s not really the point of it.\n\nThrough each death and victory, more and more of the plot, character development, and interactions are unveiled. The game respects your choices to an insane degree. Zagreus will comment on your weapon choices, whether he\u2019s died to an enemy over and over again, bosses will taunt you if they had killed you or if you killed them. You even get a chance to interact with them while is the House of Hades. Through every death Hades bemoans and chastise your dream of making it to the surface. If you die over and over, you begin to feel just as trapped as Zagreus, and you end up really wanting him (as well as yourself) to make it to the surface. So much attention to detail, as well as the gorgeous art, splendid music, and addicting and the variety the gameplay offers I can definitely see how it was a heavy hitter at the game awards. A solid game, and really worth of being in the 10/10 club.\n",

I went so into it that I was not worried even though I cleared the Tartarus only around run 100. And my first escape was on the run 193. \nI already spent 77 hours there, it seems. I still have things to do. Some NPC stories make me emotional (Achilles. just Achilles.) I love the art and it affected the way I draw. I love the music and now use it as an exercise track.

  "review": "I've played all of Supergiant Games catalog. I loved Pyre and Transistor greatly, so I was eager to play Hades when it was announced. Before I get into the review, for those who want a TL:DR, believe the hype. This game is worth it in every sense of the word. Now let's get started.\n\nThe story is incredible. You play as Zagreus, the son of Hades. He is trying to escape the Underworld and must climb his way from the House of Hades to the surface. Of course it's not going to be that easy as Hades sends minions, bosses, and more to stop Zagreus from accomplishing his goal. Zagreus is not alone however, as his aunts, uncles and cousins are the Gods of Olympus. They as well as Nyx and others lend their aid to help Zagreus on his quest. But, why is Zagreus trying to escape? Why is Hades trying to stop him? And what happens if Zagreus actually makes it to the surface?\n\nHades plays like a rouge-like game. It's a random dungeon crawler with lots of hackin' and slashin'. You will be able to use different weapons and each room you complete will reward you with upgrades known as boons, cash to spend at Charon's shop, exp points to upgrade your passives and more. Each time you run a dungeon, the layout and rewards will change which means none of your runs will be the same. Using boons from the Gods will upgrade your abilities and give them special properties, or inflict status effects on enemies when certain conditions are met, or give you ultimate abilities known as Aids, or even change what spell you can cast. The combinations are endless and it's fun to try different combinations with different weapons.\n\nThe music and voice acting is top notch like all Supergiant games and this is important as you will lose, MANY MANY TIMES. Normally this would be a bad thing, but the theme of Hades is literally you failing over and over. Each time you fail, you learn more about the story, you can upgrade your passive abilities to make your next run smoother, you can talk to characters and learn more about their backstory and motivations. Hell, you can even use some of your currency to customize the House of Hades, adding to its look or unlocking new side quests. What I'm trying to say is that, even when you lose, you are still progressing! This is the most important facet of Hades that makes it such an amazing game. So many games, especially in this genre, halt your progression if you cannot get past a certain point. In Hades, it took me 52 tries until I beat the game for the FIRST TIME. During all those tries, I felt a bond with Zagreus that maybe the next run we'd get it and when I finally achieved victory, it made it all feel worth it.\n\nFor those who are afraid of the challenge simply want to know the story, Supergiant has you covered. There is a \"God mode\" that makes the game easier for you to finish the game and see the story. You are free to turn it off and on whenever you want. I never used it, as I wanted victory to be worth all the blood, sweat, and tears. But I also praise developers who offer tools like this for players like this who struggle and I wish more would do that.\n\nThe cast of characters are so memorable. From floating Dusa cleaning the House (best girl!), to the trash talking heel that is the hero king, Theseus (love fighting him, even though that fight is a hassle each time, to even the big bad poppa himself, Hades. The voice acting really carries the story beautifully and this is a game that is meant to be beaten multiple times (you'll see why when you initially beat it). As a gamer who usually only finishes games once and stops, I already beat it a second time, and intend to do so again to see more and more of the incredible story.\n\nThere are so many things I still have not personally unlocked, but judging from how many hours I put into this game and there's still more to experience tells you that this game is worth every single penny you put into it. I have no gripes for this gem and cannot recommend enough that you play this masterpiece of a game. Share your builds with your friends and fellow players, get to know the cast, and help Zagreus escape the Unde....oh wait....there is no escape. Right? Thanks for reading!",

It took me around 80 playthroughs to get all the achievements yet for some reason I never felt bored and had not exhausted all the dialogue opportunities with most of the gods. The only possible issue I can see someone having is that there is perhaps too much to read; more than one would expect in this genre and it does feel like a visual novel at times if you want to converse with everyone. For me that's just more content. Also Artemis is best girl.",

  "review": "[b]Summary[/b] - No wonder Hades is one of the best action roguelite game. Every aspects of this game are solid. Be it top-notch fast-pace thrilling combat, amazing mix-and-match upgrade customization, fabulous aesthetics design and music, entertaining characters banter that never get old. Overall gameplay that feel rewarding to both people who love challenge and people who just want to have fun.\n\n\n[h1]Totally Recommend[/h1]\n\nHades is one big critically-acclaimed game. And it's rightfully so. It creates a very good first impression and everlasting spectacularity even people who never like rogue-ish games before could fall in love with this game.\n\nHades attract many types of gamers. Achievers who love challenges, Experimentalists who love testing character built and reactive designs or Aesthetic-lovers who would be pleased by beautiful character arts, funny bantering and great music. It's success is also blessed by many boons that make Hades stand-out during the time of rogue-ish games flourish.\n\n\n[b]Boon 1 : Failure is a part of progression [Heroic][/b]\n\nFailure in this game is a part of story-telling, character growth, your growth, many upgrades and it's fun.\n\nFor many people, one big turn-off of roguelite/like games are when they feel that their progress has been reseted, deserted, unacknowledged. Sure some achievers type of players might say you can get better but not all players are achievers, let alone that even some achievers might want to feel some progression from their small accomplishment.\n\nThen Hades nailed the first impression on me by letting one of the underworld denizen commenting on how I lost to the hydra boss after I actually just lost to one. It might be some small cosmetic reactivity but actually great in senses of narrative progression and feeling some acknowledgement. \n\nApart from some small reactive bantering. The sense of progression get deeper the more you played (or the more the game updated for ppl who played it since Early Access) there are many long-term progression in senses of both gameplay and narratives. And it compliment each other rather than undercut each other. This is quite charming part for Hades. Yes, it's a charming game to the point that it feel like continuously giving me an Ambrosia.\n\nTalk about giving an Ambrosia, an item that would further your character's relationship with other denizens in the mythology, tt further both gameplay benefit and change some dialogue dynamic with them. The gameplay change feel stronger than narrative change but it's still worth experiencing some friendship/courtship happening between Zagreus and other beings.\n\n\n[b]Boon 2 : Massive replay value and various customization [Legendary][/b]\n\nWhile the game world of Hades isn't big and repeated playthrough could bore someone but what keep many players coming back to play it again must be seemingly endless objective and sheer variety of combat customization. Even finishing the main story of the game doesn't make it immediately lost it's purpose.\n\nPeople might have different goals in mind for Hades. Be it to complete the codex. To fulfill \"the prophecy\" to further some narrative goal, to bring full potential for weapons, to complete the game with all challenging measures, or to just finally have a date with that deathgod etc. If you are a completionist this game's replayability is sky high.\n\nApart from that, for me as a more experimentalist player, I love the \"let's trying out new playstyles\" for each playthrough. And Hades even reward people for trying out different upgrade by it's \"fulfilling prophecies\" system. By upgrades I mean multitude of them.\n\nFirst you can choose the weapon, then it's 3-4 aspects can differentiate your playstyle to some extend (like rewarding you for using Special or focusing on Cast or changing how you use your special completely etc.) then there are Boons from gods or other denizen you would meet along the way. Some boon change your moves drastically and this is one most fun part for me. (for example some move make your Cast become a laser turret while some other change it into lopping bombs etc.)\n\nWhile the gameplay control itself is simple enough (Attack-Special-Cast-Dash-Call) it's mix-and-match trying to create synergy between all these movemake the game shine. In one game you can be a \"three-pronged Icy spear man with Booze-bomb lobbing\" while the other playthrough you could become a \"Magnet fist with explosive uppercut and blade-rift dancing dash\"  \n\n\n[b]Boon 3 : Reasonable challenge and also accessible [Epic][/b]\n\nThe challenge is at appropriated level in Hades. With fluid control it's not only making game feel like a fun ride but also make you feel more in control of the situation. And when you got hit or fail at something you feel like it's yourself to blame rather than clunky control like some other games.\n\nAnd challenge is also very customizable. For people who love challenge. There is \"Pact of Punishment\" system in which you can adjust what aspects of difficulty you would like to challenge yourself with. Be it \"Jury Summon\" which make you face more enemies. \"Hard Labor\" make foes hit harder. Or something interesting like \"Extreme Measures\" making bosses use  new extra special attacks.\n\nFor more casual player. You can adjust the game to be easier by using \"God mode\". No it won't make you invulnerable (at least not immediately) but will make you gain small extra damage resistance each time your character is defeated. This could make you feel more and more on par with enemies while not feeling like you are cheating. This also doesn't defeat the purpose of the game where they want you to experience multiple runs and could still make you fail as failure is a story-driven part of the game.\n\nYes Theseus, let's talk down on me about how I lost to you and your bull-friend last time. This time I will show you what I've made of.\n\nTalk about reactivity of characters' bantering...\n\n\n[b]Boon 4 : Charming character design and artwork [Duo][/b]\n\nDo I have to elaborate on this? People can see/hear for themselves. \nFor me it's \"must protecc\" for Dusa. Lover Rivalry for Megaera \nAnd Nyx is my best mysterious mom.\n\n\n[b]Boon 5 : Amazing soundtrack [Epic][/b]\n\nImagine you are trying to break away from 4 districts of Greek Myth's underworld with Athenian-flavored hard rock/metal/electronic amplifying the intensity of the fight you are in. Apart from instrumental there are also a handful of vocal tracks that are equally a great mood setting. \"Good riddance\" is my favorite.",

Every time you go back in your HUB-world there is different dialogue and areas unlocking. The dialogue even carries over to different NPCs so no matter how much you die, it always feels like you are progressing.\n\nOnly minor issue the game has is with multiple AoE upgrades, visuals cues become hard to spot, but thats it really.\n\nSoundtrack is absolutely kickass\nVoice acting fits perfectly \nArtwork is just amazing\nDozen of upgrades and different playstyle enabling you to play the game for weeks on end without it ever feeling truly repetitive despite you having to start over every time you die.\n\nThe game is definitely worth FULL price, hell I even think they are undercharging, its worth at least 35-40\u20ac . This is the one of THE most complete games I have ever played. I'd argue it has +2 DLCs worth of content in the base game, that's how much there is. 1 or 2 more stages could have been made for DLCs in the future because there are only 3 but changed up enough that it takes a good while until you have truly 'seen it all'\n\nHope this review makes anyones decision to get the game or not easier.",

  "review": "I have over 100 hours logged between PC and Switch at this time using cross-saves. This is probably hyperbolic and due partially to recency bias but Hades is one of the best fucking games ever made. The action is addictive and so fast-paced at times that my fingers are operating by assumption and muscle memory with not a clear comprehension of what's happening on screen. This is a testament to the quality of gameplay because despite that, more often than not it works out. The writing, voice acting, and story is all excellent and the amount of dialogue is absolutely absurd. I have a spot in my heart designated for Binding of Isaac so I don't know if I can say Hades is the best rogue-lite ever made but it probably is and is worth a shot even for people that might not be fans of the genre. It's a masterpiece and at 25 USD is a steal and regularly goes on sale for 20 USD so there's very little reason not to try it out.",

Then the tick damage from the poison is SO fast that you will no shit lose 40+ HP before you can even dash to the antidote pot, which is unclickable if there is a mob next to it so by the time you can click the mob you will sometimes lose over 200+ HP.

  "review": "As someone who is a lukewarm fan of Roguelites, I caved and picked the game up one day, thinking it'd be a fun diversion.\nThis diversion would be 80 hours and I plan on playing more in the future.\n\nRoguelites usually lose me because:\nIf the gameplay is repetitive or is just for gameplay's sake, it needs to be multiplayer or have narrative/character draw. Roguelites, as they revolve around resetting progress (permadeath), they don't lend themselves to gripping me, outside of some mindless fun with systems for a few hours.\n\nHades, brilliantly, I might add, takes this genre weakness and actually puts the permadeath mechanic in the place of lead narrative engine.\n\nThe character art is so well executed, that it feels animated. The voice acting and character interactions are engaging, and Good Lord, they must have spent 75% of their investments on voice acting. There is SO MUCH voice acting, that the fact that it is so well directed and acted shows how well this studio deals with this game format.\n\nAddictively fun and stay for the characters; similar to the Persona series, in that way.\n\nNegatives?\nAfter over 65 hours, some of the worlds and music get repetitive.\nFor 25 bucks or 20 on sale, that negative feels really unfair; the value here is immense, and the polish alone makes anything less than a 9.5 an error.\n\nIf I was forced to rate it, I'd give it a 9.8\n\nWhat I find more helpful is this, though: as someone who doesn't usually get a whole lot out of the genre, I'm really glad I decided to take the risk to pick up this game.\n\nKudos!",

  "review": "This game is truly incredible. I generally don't care for roguelikes but the team at Supergiant truly perfected it. The core gameplay loop is extremely solid, with a surprising amount of mechanical depth to dive into. There's a wide variety of weapons in the game, each with their own unique playstyle and charms that you can work on upgrading between runs. During the run, you have even more variety in the form of Boons that enhance certain skills and are unlocked randomly through randomly arranged rooms. Every single run is different, even when using the same weapon. And if pure RNG isn't your thing, you still have some influence in the form of keepsakes you can bring into every run to help direct your build.\n\nThe game's story and characters are incredible. The story is told during and in between runs and really makes dying a part of the tale. Every single character in the game is designed and written with so much care and passion that makes them a joy to talk to as you watch your relationships evolve. I'm usually not one to go around talking to every NPC I meet and usually just want to get to the gameplay loop, but I found myself excitedly awaiting being able to progress every conversation in the game.\n\n\nThe game's art style is incredible. Every part of the map is hand drawn with so much care and attention to detail, and the level design is excellent. The character art makes every character unique and lets you even see their relationships with other characters in subtle ways.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is incredible. Every level has its own themes, and the boss battle music tracks are absolute bangers.\n\nThe voice acting is honestly incredible. I'd love listening to every single character talk just to listen to each one's personality in their voice.\n\nThis game. Is. Incredible. The passion put into it bleeds through at every single opportunity. I'd go on but I don't think anyone would read anything longer. Just get it and play it. The game deserves to be played.",

The combat system is designed in such a way that no two runs of the game could be same. That what makes each run special.\nIn one instance, I unlocked a new weapon and that added with getting the right build along the way carried me way further and any run I did before, that's how unpredictably skill based the game is. You can cheese your way through the game fairly easily once you develop the skill but there's also an aspect of luck that's the defining factor for your difficulty in doing so, which makes re-playability a treat!\n\n10/10 - Would strongly recommend",

The action is fun and engaging, the story is so well paced that even after you are tired of playing the game and need to take a break you will always be willing to come back to it. It might just draw you into a marathon of runs, it sure did that for me. \n\nThe graphics and visuals are seamless and very tasteful, the sound design and music are just so well done and inspiring, and the voice acting is on fleek. I honestly have no criticism of this game, my only wish is for some type of old school style expansion pack so the progression between layers of the underworld wasn't always the exact same thing. \n\nDo your self a favor and buy this game.

  "review": "Im gonna be honest, this isnt a game for everyone, but like always ill give me input rather than tell you if the game is worth buying or not, so you can figure it out by yourself.\n\nThis game resembles Heavily The Diablo Franchise.\n\nLet's Start With The Story:\n\nDeep Benneth the Realm of the living lies The Underworld, Ruled by the all mighty Lord Hades, God of Dead.\nHades is portrayed as this almighty ruler, But because everyone is dead he needs to do all this work.\nIn his presence and also the playable character is Zagreus, The Prince of Darkness and Death.\n\nIn the meantime above the earth in Olympus is Zeus, Poseidon, Ares, Athena, Dionysus, Artemis, Aphrodite and Hermes that are unaware of Zagreus. Once Zagreus Starts Defying his father, they help Zagreus reach Olympus, facing many challanges in their way.\n\nThe Story is pretty good, however the veracity of some things in the real mythology is flawed.\nAside from the Plot Holes the story is pretty solid. 7/10\n\nCombat System:\n\nI can't say i liked the combat system, because in fact its pretty rough at times, especially Cancelling Animations. Sometimes you need to wait more than 1.5/2 seconds before you can attack after special or cast which makes the fighting hard when you get swarned by enemies.\n\nAnother strikingly odd thing is the amount of weapons the game posses. \nSpoilers From Here On Out\n\nThe Game Provides you with the [spoiler] Stygian Blade [/spoiler] right at the beginning arguable the best weapon for any situation making the [spoiler] Shield of Chaos [/spoiler], [spoiler] Heart-Seeking Bow[/spoiler] and [spoiler] The Eternal Spear [/spoiler] nearly useless in the long run.\n\nThe Other 2 Weapons Provide a nice and interesting playstyle that i can accept. 5/10\n\nLevel Design:\n\nThe Game Builds its levels around multiple chambers that reset everytime you complete an escape, having different things to do the much you adventure into the game.\nYou can furthurmore increase or decrease the difficulty by activating \"God mode\" Reducing your dmg taken by 20% + 2% everytime you finish a run.\nThe Problem Lies in how repetive it gets after the 25/50th run. 6/10\n\nThe Enemies:\n\nProbably the single best reminder that this game's mechanics are not to mess around with.\nI felt like playing Dodgeball around most chambers since my Dodge key was beeing pressed more often than my W A S D. since you getting 2 tapped by someone means half of your hp is gone.\nYou can feel the intensity of the battle everytime you step into a new chamber. 7/10\n\nThe OST: Here it comes my favorite part of the entire game. The Official SoundTrack.\nAll chambers have a different vibe and the music ajusts to it.\nI Dont have a single criticism about this, Trully a masterpiece for the ages.\nYou can understand the tone of the chamber or Boss fight by the music itself, having the volume of the music automaticly raising everytime you take damage or lowering if you have a decent hp.\nI never give 10/10 to any game. But a solid 9/10 for the OST needs to be given here.\n\nVoice Acting:\n\nDisclaimer: I play all my games in english so this is for english only.\nThe Voice acting is really sparked however the accent of all characters is british, when it should've been greek-ish for the theme of greek mythology.\nBut thats a minor detail i would've changed all an all pretty solid as well. 8/10\n\nIm loving this game, its really fun and makes me so surprised how so many people agree with me.\nSince as you know im more of a fps's kinda person, this game is really well made and my personal opinion wont change because of some minor details\n\nOverall 7/10",

I enjoy finding amazing combinations and even if you randomly choose different gods and boons, chances are you will still get a monstrous amalgamation that works.\nThen the story, while it may appear simplistic, can be very detailed and its depth is revealed as the game progresses, making each run (because you will be doing dozens to get the full story) more and more interesting and appealing.\nThe graphics themselves are nothing to sneeze at.

Seen it once, seen it all. Each area is always the same.\n-There is little to no variety for bosses. They do get new abilities later on but that doesn't mean it's an entirely new boss.\n-No dungeon variety at all, every area is the same, has the same enemies and the bosses are in order too, what fun.\n\nAfter 3 hours I had seen (almost) everything the game had to offer, so close to getting my refund too...\nThe things that are supposed to keep you engaged are the cosmetic unlocks (not for your character, only for furniture etc), some hidden things, the story and character relationships.\nIf you're like me and don't give a damn about either and just want to enjoy the gameplay then, by all means, don't buy this unless it's half price or less.\nDon't get me wrong, the gameplay is amazing, but if you're fighting the same enemies and bosses in the same order over and over again while hoping to get the rare skills you want for a fun run then it get's old extremely quickly.",

Certainly I can appreciate and understand why they're so beloved in their respective communities but personally , it's just never clicked in for me either. So just as Hades came out and achieved it's expected fanfare and acclaim as a SuperGiant title , I was of course still sceptical about my own enjoyment of the game knowing my set-in-stone tastes for the genre already; and OF COURSE SuperGiant had to be the one to prove me wrong and entrance me in this utterly brilliant game! \n\nYou're directly pitted into the role of Zagreus, Greek Demi-God , looking to leave the Underworld behind for pastures new and searching for your mysterious mother. As you fight your way through room upon room of enemies , you may or may not eventually die of course and return only to learn more about the beautiful cast of characters here. All impeccably voice-acted and drawn, I don't think I've ever heard an interaction go the same way twice before and that's certainly a part of the magic of the game - you feel your relationships blossom and evolve with different individuals. You come to understand what each of their motivations are the longer you play the game and I imagine that's quite a rarity for a title in the genre where you really feel that each death whilst sure, is frustrating initially, only goes on to provide you with more background, detail, upgrades even and who doesn't want to pet that adorable hell hound [i]Cerberus[/i].\n\nThe gameplay of course is where much of the muscles of a roguelike are flexed and what's on offer here is of Olympian proportions , that you can be assured. You have one of six weapons to choose from at the start of each run and during your attempted escape you'll come across upgrades and enhancement to your abilities, weapon and life. Seemingly hundreds of variations can be created out of these randomizations making each run superbly varied in its challenge and satisfaction. Experimentation here is absolutely crucial and will allow to deepen your knowledge of the games systems and intricacies in order to consistently destroy runs over and over again. There's just endless content here for those that really enjoy stretching the life out of their game and you won't regret it one bit for every death (or win? ) means more to learn and develop. \n\nSuperGiant have once again created an absolute gem of a game and one that I believe to stand at the very top of its genre. \n",

  "review": "YES! YES! YES! this game is amazing I 100% this game and enjoyed every minute of it, it's worth the 25$ get it now it is worth the time! It takes place in Greek times which you get to play as the son of Hades who's name is Zagreus who wants to reach the surface world just to get away from the underworld. You will be aided by the friends you make along the way and the relatives on Olympus whom are the gods/goddesses ranging from, Artemis, Ares, Dionysus, Zeus, Aphrodite, Demeter, Poseidon, Hermes, Athena, and Chaos who will supply you with Boons to help you with your fights to the death. There are a total of 6 weapons from range to melee which consist of, Stygian Blade, Heart-seeking Bow, Shield of Chaos, The Eternal Spear, Twin Fists, and the Adamant Rail. This game also as a amazing art style and visual details if you have the money or looking for a game to play I highly recommend this masterpiece.",

  "review": "[h1]Name's Hades, Lord of the dead. Hi, how ya doin'?\n[i]~Hades (Hercules, 1997)[/i][/h1]\n\nThe fourth (and latest at the moment I write this review) game from my most beloved indie developer \u2013 [b]Supergiant Games[/b], [b]Hades[/b] got a lot of praise. Like... [i]a lot[/i]. Sure, both press and players always loved the guys. But this time? It ended up as one of the most praised games of the year. Surprisingly, even though I loved the fact that [b]Supergiants[/b] finally got the praise they deserve, I must say that... [b]Hades[/b] is actually my least favorite game from them. Don't get me wrong, though, [b]Hades[/b] is a great game. You enjoy [b]Action Roguelike[/b] genre? You should totally check this one out. And yet, there are some reasons why I never liked it nearly as much as those previous titles.\n\nAs you can easily guess, [b]Supergiants[/b] decided to try something new again. That's one of the best things about them, really. Unlike many others who keep making the same exact thing again and again just because it sells well, [b]Supergian Games[/b] are always looking for something new. Something they didn't try yet. Something that maybe even nobody tried yet. This time it's a [b]100% Action Roguelike[/b] and... it's kind of a problem. At least, for me. I mean, all of their previous games tried to show us some unique elements. The broken world in [b]Bastion[/b], the tactical mode in [b]Transistor[/b], a weird take on football in [b]Pyre[/b]... There was always something. Here? It's just an [b]Action Roguelike[/b]. Very polished, very satisfying and yet... just [b]Action Roguelike[/b]. Sure, there are still some things to make [b]Hades[/b] to stand out but... they actually make things worse.\n\nWhatever you do, [i]do not[/i] expect [b]Diablo[/b] here. Or [b]Torchlight[/b]. Or whatever. The first and most important thing you should know about [b]Hades[/b] is that... it's a grind fest. See, technically, [b]Hades[/b] is laughably short game. It comes with only four floors and six basic bosses, only four of which you can meet per one run. That's it. That's the entire game. Four areas, four bosses, about hour and a half long. [i]But[/i]. That's where our big \u201cbut\u201d comes in. To actually see the ending, you'll need to beat the game ten times. Which makes it fifteen hours long for an unexperienced player, but also... makes it kinda... boring? I mean, sure, gameplay here is fast-paced, surprisingly polished and very addicting. It's also very fun to do some personal challenges here. Like speedruns, for example (the game actually has some awesome in-built tools for that so you can customize your playthroughs by making things harder for yourself) but... that doesn't change the fact that you'll just keep doing the same exact things again and again with no end. And at some point, probably long before you'll see the ending, repetitiveness will start getting on your nerves. I mean, in games like [b]Diablo[/b], the casual players can be satisfied just by beating the story, while for those who wants grinding, there are both multiplayer and endgame. In [b]Hades[/b]? You can't just go for the story and ignore everything else. Whether you want it or not \u2013 playing the same four areas again and again is the only way to see the ending. And after you'll see the ending? * sigh * good grief, there'll be even more grinding. For some extra ending... which doesn't even worth it... Because [i]reasons[/i].\n\nAh, and guess what? Every time you die? You'll start all over again. Like in [b]Dead Cells[/b], for example. You die \u2013 the entire run becomes unsuccessful. And, most likely, you [i]will[/i] die. Because this game can be pretty challenging at times [i]and[/i] you can't just carry tons of healing items with you. Like in many other games. [b]Hades[/b] takes more arcade-like approach on that matter. See, in this game it'll be all about choices. Every area here is, like, a series of rooms. Every room will have its own reward and you'll know which room comes with which reward before entering. And the only real way to heal will be selecting the room with healing reward. Technically, there'll be more ways to heal, like talents and special rooms, but those will come later, while the main source of healing will be to clear the rooms with healing reward.\n\nTalking about the rewards. Technically, the idea was pretty interesting. You're free to choose your rewards and therefore every single run will be a bit different. You'll make your own selection of buffs, you'll collect so-called \u201cdarkness\u201d which will allow you to unlock some talents and so on. The problem is \u2013 you'll lose all of it right after you'll finish your current run. The only things you'll keep will be the currencies which you'll be able to use at your home to unlock stuff like new weapons, health boosts and so on. Everything else will be removed, so... the next run will feel a lot like a fresh start. Not completely, of course, thanks to the currencies I've mentioned above, but still, that juicy feeling of getting stronger with every run? It isn't there. Just because sometimes there'll be runs from which you won't even get much. And if you'll die... well, [i]excu-u-u-u-u-u-use me[/i], Princess! It's hard to scare the hardcore roguelike fans with such stuff, of course, but the casual players? Those may not find that entertaining at all.\n\nMy biggest problem here, though, is the fact that story feels kinda... lacking this time. I mean, that's what [b]Supergiant Games[/b] are known for. Complicated stories with deep narration. The story about the kid in a broken world that makes you think about forgiveness in [b]Bastion[/b]... \u201cHi!\u201d thing from [b]Transistor[/b]'s finale that alone deserves a bloody reward... Trials and choices from [b]Pyre[/b]... there's nothing like that in [b]Hades[/b]. Sure, it's still a pretty charming game and [b]Darren Korb[/b]'s songs with [b]Ashley Barrett[/b]'s vocals are still there, but the story this time is pretty simple [i]and[/i] I can't say I liked the comic approach. I mean, I admire the fact that [b]Supergiants[/b] tried something new even with the atmosphere but still... basic comedies are not where they shine for real. And yet, here were are... bright atmosphere and some basic jokes.\n\nSo... yeah. That's [b]Hades[/b] for you. A pretty charming fast-paced [b]Action Roguelike[/b] with only four areas and tons of grinding. Like I said, it's not like it's a bad game. It's very well made, it has a pretty bright and funny atmosphere and all in all, it's a very solid indie title. Mostly for those who like the genre, but still, it's good. And yet, while previous games from [b]Supergiants[/b] were, like, pure art, this one? It's just a really well-made game. So, keep in mind that it isn't a story-driven game and be careful with your expectations. Dixi.",

  "review": "I'm not normally one to make reviews, but even with the small amount of time I have put in this game I feel as though I need to make a review on this. I am 100% not a fan of the roguelike genre. Not that I hate it or anything, it's just that I'm not a fan of constantly having to restart without making any progress in my overall playthrough, and I've always kind of felt discouraged from continuing in other games. However, Hades is different.\n\nThis game doesn't punish you for dying and having to restart, in fact it rewards you, and I'm not even entirely sure you can beat the game without having to die once (I'm sure someone could probably prove me wrong considering the fact I'm not great at beating games) since you learn more story and features to help you in escaping the Underworld after dying and being sent back to your home. There are tons of collectables that help you increase your stats, and give you other perks, at a pretty steady pace so you don't feel as though you're not making any impact, while also not making it seem like you barely have to work for it. The voice acting and music are also amazing, but that's not surprising coming from Supergiant.\n\nBasically, this game is the perfect game for both roguelike fans and non fans. It's super fun and has a very interesting and compelling story and I 100% recommend you try it out if you have $25 to buy something worthwhile.",

  "review": "\nGeneral: \n\nRating: T\nPrice:  $24.99\nGenre: Action-Roguelike, Rogue-lite, RPG?\nTime played:  74.4 Hours.\n\nA great action roguish game. Battle your way out of the underworld, defy your father. Learn the truth about your existence. Pet the 3 headed dog. \n\nGameplay - 10\n\nQuick, fast and brutal.  There\u2019s so much to do in the underworld. People to meet, people to kill. Barriers to break.  As Zagreus, the son of Hades you\u2019re trying to escape the underworld looking for your mother.  Your father forbids it and so now you have to fight your way out.  The gods of Olympus offer their help in various boons that can affect your dash, attack or magic powers.  You will gain more and more experience each run, unlocking more things that will help you in your runs.  There\u2019s also a Hardcore mode that starts off with a contract you have to agree to so that you can power up your weapons.  Oh did i mention you have 6 different weapons, eventually, that you can use in your escapes.   \n\nStory -  10\n\nWe all know the story about how Persphone was tricked into living in the Underworld half the year, You do know this part of roman/greek mythology right? Anyways this is the story of Zagreus the son of Persphone and Hades.  He has always been stuck in the Underworld and now wants out, he\u2019s looking for his mother and only knows that she is outside the underworld.   You recruit various gods/goddesses to help you along your way making yourself more and more powerful until eventually you break free and discover\u2026. \n\nGraphics - 10 \n\nExcellent, no complaints. \n\nControls - 10 (controller)\n\nI always prefer the controller over mouse/keyboard so to me this game was wonderful with a controller, others might say the mouse/keyboard is better. Either way the controls were fantastic and I had no problems with them at all. \n\nRepeatability -\n\nRoguish games like idle games tend to have you doing the same thing over and over.  So yea  you\u2019ll be repeating the game over and over. \n\nMusic - ??\n\nTense when it needed to be, cheerful and light when it needed.  It was music and did well with the game. \n\nMultiplayer - N/A\n\nInitial Thoughts: \n\nI haven\u2019t played a good action roguelike in a while. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on here.  17 runs later.  Okay.  I need to sleep after this one it\u2019s\u2026 crap looks like i\u2019m calling off work. \n\n\nSoma Says: \n\nFantastic.  Every part of this game made me want to come back for more.  The story is good and makes you feel a part of it, each accomplishment you earned and it\u2019s great.  As many people point out you can pet the doggo.  So there\u2019s that. \n\nI feel like this game is a perfect example of what a roguish game can be, it also reminds me of how far the genre has come.  Buy the game and you won\u2019t regret it. \n\n\nIf you enjoyed the review check out my curator page : https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28849369/\n\n\n",

Very high replayability and continuous progress between runs, constantly unlocking new upgrades and a very extensive post-game with punishment pacts.\n\n- Huge amount of content and lore.

Said gripes basically boil down to there being too many dialogue options. Now having so much dialogue is an incredible thing it really is and I love it tough it does cause a problem. You need some dialogue to get different weapon aspects and when I need to die to get new dialogue when there is so much it feels like I just need to sink an absurd about of time to get the prior mentioned weapon aspects when I kind of just don't want to. Now all things considered this isn't a huge impact and I would say even if you are not willing to put in a ton of hours at the moment then I would still recommend the game cause it is just an absolute blast!",

Thus the graphics are quite attractive, the gameplay is purely joyful and perfectly challenging and the story is to completely die for. The game grants you the chance to come up with a build of your own, thus making each and every run feel far from the same. Levels are randomly generated properly, as they should always be when it comes to roguelikes / roguelites.\n\nYou are able to interact with certain characters and improve your relationship with them; able to customize the House of Hades and make it as appealing as you want, and you can also choose the weapon you wish to use pre run from a total of 6 unique ones.\n\nThis game is riddled with amazing stories, epic soundtracks, epic boss fights, epic interactions and overall epic gameplay. Hell, even the fishing feels epic when you're at it.\n\nPersonally, I haven't encountered any issues or bugs ever since I got the game, though I'd assume nothing is perfect. What matters is that Supergiant Games always checks in with the fanbase and actually cares about it, so no matter what issue you could possibly encounter, chances are it will be fixed in a jiffy should you report it.\n\nTo be quite frank, you'd have to be either deaf or blind.. or both to not enjoy this game.",

Great story, absolutely stunning artstyle, banging soundtrack that you will be wanting to listen on Spotify and just enjoying it without being in constant danger, great humor and especially quotes from Zagreus during fights but also in House of Hades chatting with other characters, great system of permanent upgrades, awesome hit & dodge combat, very challenging but at the same time very fair and rewarding and you have that special feel that you are getting somewhere. Hades is easily GOTY of 2020 without a doubt and every fan of rogue-likes/lites should definitely give it a shot. Reviews ratio here on Steam will tell you that this is just an awesome game. And if you ask me, it's 9/10...or you know what easily 10/10. Just freaking awesome.",

[b]Good titles are rare, and Hades is a diamond in the rough. This game is a unique masterpiece.[/b]\n\nThe story mixes very well with death mechanic, which is hard achieve in roguelites. The comic book art style and voicing deliver the story in a way that it's rare to see. Let's talk gameplay, combat is super fluid, with any of the many weapons you've available. You'll often find yourself switching from attack to attack, enemy to enemy. While all this is happening, the carnage is being supported by the fantastic soundtrack in Hades. Has for replayability I'm currently sitting at 15 hours and finished my first run. And the best part is there still so much to do.\n\n[u]TL:DR: If you're into roguelike/roguelites buy the game.

  "review": "[h1]Fastlane Review: Hades[/h1] \n \n[b]There is no escape \u2013 but you\u2019d never want to.[/b]\n\n[u][h1]Premise:[/h1][/u]\nAn isometric action Rogue-lite where you play as Zagreus, Son of Hades. Zagreus decides he\u2019s had enough of being trapped in his father\u2019s Underworld kingdom, and makes a break for the surface world \u2013 slaying every monster in his path throughout 4 procedurally generated layers of Hell. The great Gods of Olympus are sympathetic to his situation, and lend their powers to aid his escape, increasing his combat abilities. Should he be slain in the attempt, he\u2019ll be sent back to the House of Hades to spend resources he collects and to chat with his family and co-workers.\n\n[u][h1]Gameplay:[/h1][/u]\nEnter a new room, smash the enemies, collect rewards, proceed, repeat. The formula is simple and easy to grasp, yet the sheer variety in combat and options available to the player is one of the most praiseworthy features of the game. Each \u2018layer\u2019 of the Underworld has different room layouts, and new enemies to fight against, each culminating in a boss battle. Six different weapons on offer, and each plays in a unique way, leaving it up to the player to find their own favorite style \u2013 from quick combo-based melee attacks of the Stygian Blade to the safe, long ranged style of the Heart-Seeking Bow, with how separate and distinct each weapon is, anyone can find a favorite, something they are most comfortable with but it doesn\u2019t end there. Every weapon also has three more \u2018aspects\u2019 to be unlocked and each changes how the weapon functions, sometimes drastically. Combine this with the hundreds of Boons, offered by 10 separate Deities, with each God of Olympus offering different modifiers to a weapon\u2019s moves, passive benefits or changes to generic abilities that can be used with any weapon, no two runs through the Underworld will be the same. Like any Roguelike/lite experience, the variety is well enforced by the random nature of the rewards, you\u2019re never given full control over which Boons and benefits you\u2019re offered, so the player is encouraged to experiment with many different options.\nControls are smooth and polished, every weapon feels satisfying to use, and the combat is fast-paced and just [i]fun.[/i] It all lends to a smooth rhythm of one hard-fought battle right after another which makes the game VERY hard to put down once you\u2019re on a roll. \nWith each victory Zagreus will grow stronger, weather from gaining new Boons for use in the current attempt, or resources to spent in-between runs \u2013 a note of praise to be said for that the most common and plentiful of resources are also the ones that are most useful for unlocking passive benefits that will make the game easier \u2013 without ever removing the challenge or being an overly simplistic \u2018your numbers are bigger now\u2019\nSpeaking of challenge, the \u2018Pact of Punishment\u2019, the game\u2019s way of providing steadily increasing difficulty, is downright brilliant. The player is free to adjust more than 10 different parameters to make each run more challenging, ranging from simple such as enemies dealing more damage or having more health, to more devious such as the player having a time limit to clear each region, or being presented with fewer choices when selecting a boon, leaving the player to ignore things they may hate and crank up those they\u2019re comfortable dealing with. This is a perfect way to present increasing the difficulty as one step at a time, rather than overwhelming a player with too many changes at once.\n\n[u][h1]Story:[/h1][/u]\nNormally this could be a one-paragraph section, or skipped entirely for most similar Roguelikes or Rogue-lites, but for Hades that couldn\u2019t be farther from the case. The character writing and script for this game is nothing short of excellent \u2013 especially our lead character, Zagreus \u2013 an embodiment of a well realized wish-fulfillment character. He always has the perfect thing to say \u2013 snarky about most things, sensitive and sympathetic in the right situations, confident, well-spoken, and altogether awesome \u2013 he leaves the impression that either you want to be more like him, or you\u2019d want him to be your best friend.\nThe supporting cast is great too, especially the Olympian Gods aiding Zagreus, an ensemble that resembles a sit-com cast (but it\u2019s way better than that sounds!) with Athena acting as the calm, logical older sister who just wishes everyone could get along, Poseidon the goofy dad/uncle who tries way too hard to be impressive and \u2018cool\u2019, Zeus the blowhard patriarch who can\u2019t the respect he believes he\u2019s due, Dionysus the ultimate party animal frat bro, or Aphrodite seeming sweet and attentive \u2013 if you\u2019re the one she has her eyes on. Cross her or get in her way and her true, petty and manipulative nature is laid bare (just like everything else!). \nEach and every one of is unique and distinct, and each is full of excellent and memorable dialogue. I especially like the characterization of Ares, who\u2019s extremely calm and polite but without question a violent killer as he\u2019ll often remind you. It would be been so easy to just write him as a buffoon, as many Greek Myth takes do.\nThis isn\u2019t even getting into Zagreus\u2019 co-workers and family who reside in the house of Hades, who are all just as well-written as the rest, though their stories tend to be much more personal and emotional to contrast the zaniness of the Olympians. Without veering in to spoiler territory, there is much to be done with Zagreus helping them confront their inner turmoils and setting right what had gone wrong in the past, long before the in-game narrative begins.\nNoteworthy is that nearly every \u2018in-game\u2019 aspect is given an \u2018in-universe\u2019 explanation, which is very rare for this type of game - by far the most common cliche for any roguelike story to  employ is a time-travel or alternate dimensions explanation for the endless different re-runs. This game tries a lot harder than that. Once again for fear of spoilers, I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n[u][h1]Presentation:[/h1][/u]\nDripping with style. The game\u2019s graphics, though 2D and far from a technical marvel, are downright artistically gorgeous. Each setting of the \u2018layers\u2019 of the Underworld are all very different and distinct, the character designs are unique and well-made, the effects of all the different weapons and powers in combat are really cool, nothing is lacking and the game is top to bottom colorful, flashy, and lovingly crafted. What\u2019s more is that the sound design is just as excellent \u2013 the music is rather good (though I\u2019ll admit Elysium\u2019s battle music did start to grate on me after a time) and sounds of combat with all the different enemies against all your different powers are impactful and satisfying. \nSpecial praise has to be given to the voice-acting, which is absolutely superb \u2013 with so many different characters it\u2019s a huge plus that not one of them is weak in this department especially seeing as there is so much dialogue in this game. \nI could go on but it would be a stream of hyperbolic superlative. I\u2019ll append it to: this game\u2019s graphics and sound design are very [i]very[/i] good.\n\n[u][h1]TL:DR [/h1][/u]\nThe real deal.\nA remarkable, once-in-a-generation game and at such a laudable price-point, unless you absolutely [i]cannot stand[/i] Roguelike mechanics, you have no excuse not to play it.",

Grinding Heat and pushing your score is extremly fun and satisfying.\nDifferent weapons and boons provide a variety of playstyles and stop the game from getting stale.\n\nOne negative: The game requires you to grind resources a lot in the beginning until you unlock all weapons, upgrade them and get your mirror abilities. It takes quite a long time to get to the meat of the gameplay.",

  "review": "Overall, though i can kinda recomend this game for roguelike-fans, i low-key do not understrand why it's GOTY-nominated and such, first run made me want to do a refund, lately it got much more enjoyable, but it still got lots of cons that prevent this game from becoming one of my favs. First of all, i'm not a fan of visual style, colors seem inverted, secondly, though there's plenty of stuff to unlock through completion, monsters are kinda boring and not imaginative (yea, way to go, lets kill rats and skeletons in roguelike game in 2021). Only 4 levels in general, but you can juggle with weapons and boons. Fighting system is fun and fast-paced, with explosions and lots of AOE. Being a nice game, it still lacks alot (having Dead Cells, Isaac, Rogue legacy etc as examples of a good game)\n[spoiler] The Death aka Thanatos is geh [/spoiler]",

  "review": "Isometric games which aren't old-school CRPGs bother me quite a lot; it's not a camera style that makes sense in an up-tempo, controller-based game. Sometimes your real battle is being accurately lined up with an enemy on the screen. Bastion annoyed me for the same reason; I'll probably give that one another chance.\n\nThat said, Hades is an instant classic. The animation is generally superb, the visual information in hectic combat is *mostly* good, the soundtrack is of a very high quality, etc. \n\nThere's a lot to praise.\n\nThe main attraction is the story and gameplay: a good combination of relaxed hack-n-slash combat with quality voice acting. The Greek-Mythology-inspired abilities you acquire are diverse enough that any challenge the game presents is easy and, more importantly, fun to overcome.",

  "review": "I originally bought this game for my Nintendo Switch and have sunk MANY hours into it. I liked it so much however, that I also bought it for the pc, so that I can also play it there, when portability isn't important. \nBeing very interested in greek mythology myself, the game's protagonist's name, Zagreus, had my interest piqued from the start, as it indicated a much more in depth research and subsequent presentation of the source material. AKA a willingness to go beyond the whole ''haha look at that horndog Zeus''-trope. Now, after being very intrigued by the artstyle, I heard/read somewhere how the developers where trying to implement the concept of ''heroic nudity'' in their game, which further reinforced the suspicion in my mind that this must be a very well researched and thought-out game. So I bought it. And I bought, mind you, while never having had any interest in roguelike games up to that point. Quite the contrary, I had always found this game concept mildly unappealing.\nWell, after many, MANY hours spent playing this game, I have completely changed my mind. Apart from the lore and the story and the artstyle which originally drew me in and havent disappointed me at all, I also found out that I actually liked the gameplay very much! There are just so many things to do, explore, find out and try out, that the endless cycle of death and rebirth in this game doesnt induce any fatigue, but on the contraty truly urges you to just try one more time to get it right. Again and again and again. \nAnyway I could go on about this game for hours (btw I havent mentioned the soundtrack, which is FANTASTIC in and of itself) but the bottom line is that it truly is a masterpiece, according to my opinion, which respectfully weaves the source lore into an interesting story for you to explore, while gracefully and powerfully whacking the endless hordes of the planes of the underworld and listening to a divinely (;D) composed soundtrack. I loved it.\n",

It was fun for a little but wore off so quickly. I turned the heat high for fun; giving my self a time limit, making armored foes stronger, reducing hp, everything pretty much; and that made it hard - albeit almost impossible. But at that point, it isn't a realistic challenge. I beat the games story so quickly the rest is just void. Took under 30 deaths. I even got those special weapons for the spear and sword, but they aren't fun nor very helpful. You may like this game, but, to a seasoned gamer, it isn't very hard.",
