  "review": "This game probably isn't for every, BUT, if you think it might be for you, then it definitely is.\n\nRather than \"puzzle solving\", playing TIS-100 is more like \"problem solving\". Just solving the levels at all would be interesting enough, but optimizing those solutions is where the game really shines. Any given level can be approached with a number of different strategies, each of which may be better or worse along each of the three metrics the game encourages you to optimize for. Rather than global leaderboards, the game presents global histograms, to give you a general idea of where a good solution lands in each metric, and local leaderboards pulled from your steam friends list, so you can compete against people you actually know, instead of the usual leaderboard experience of seeing yourself at #52199 or wherever and just feeling discouraged.\n\nThere were a few things I thought would be annoying at first, but quickly learned to love. The lack of registers leads to you find creative ways of minimizing how much state you use, storing state in communication queues, and otherwise trying to avoid clobbering ACC. The small instruction windows naturally lead you into figuring out how to pipeline and parallelize your programs, which turn out to be critically important optimization techniques later on. The scant instruction set leads you to find creative workarounds using other properties of the system or just other instructions - particularly JRO, which is my favorite instruction and, in my opinion, the biggest hidden gem of this game.\n\nOf all the Zachtronics titles, it's probably the most balanced and most tightly designed one. It's also, in my opinion, the hardest one. There are a LOT of puzzles, every one is a unique challenge, and there's no feature of the instruction set that you won't find yourself using regularly. It's minimal, but that's just a byproduct of having no gimmicks.\n\nMy only complaints are ergonomic ones: no volume controls, only 3 saves slots per level, and the text areas aren't as fully featured as I'd like.",

So you'll end up having to think outside the box a lot, figuring out alternative ways towards the small bits and pieces you need in order to complete the overarching task. It's a lot of \"optimizing\" your own way of thinking in a sense.\nAnd if you let it, this stuff can *really* get into your head.\n\nThat being said though, this stuff gets complicated fast.\nThe game does a pretty good job at easing you into the more difficult things by giving you more straightforward tasks at first. Frequently enough, later tasks will build up on top of the solutions you come up with for earlier tasks. So while the tools you have available don't ever change much, what *does* change is the toolset that is your experience with the system.\nEssentially, the ideas you use to solve early puzzles will become tools for later puzzles.\n\nThose later puzzles however can get *really* tight on your operation counts. And if you don't think hard about micro-optimizations every now and then, some of those may be nearly impossible to beat.\n\nAlso, don't expect your tasks to be all that glorious.\nYou develop a division algorithm. Or you draw simple pictures on the screen. Or maybe you develop a sorting algorithm. If you have dealt with high-level programming languages before, it's basically all about implementing their kinds of features, but without actually *using* any of their kinds of features.\nThe part that's fun about that though is when you go into it thinking that it should very much not be possible, given the very limited toolset that you have available, but then later notice that you just managed to pull it off anyway. \"Performing a division using only addition and subtraction operations? How is that supposed to work?\"\n\nThis is a really good brainteaser game. And if you can get past the first hurdles of reading a boring programming manual, and there being absolutely nothing visually appealing besides some white code blocks on a black background, and there being *literally nothing* besides the puzzle presented to you, then you're in for something that can keep you busy for quite a few hours.\n\n(Or, if you get too into it, one or the other sleepless night.)",

I've just completed this game with 100% achievements and I've spent more hours on this game than obtaining 100% achievements for Dark Souls 1 & 2, but quite a number of it was probably spent falling asleep. The only thing these games have in common is that you'd be on the verge of giving up but you know they are solvable problems because many before you have done so. I studied electrical engineering and I do a fair bit of coding in my work so the workings of assembly wasn't entirely foreign to me, and I knew the basics of debugging and using pseudo-code to formulate solutions. I've a few tips below:\n\n1) Always begin by using pen and paper to prepare the logic behind your solution. This can be in the form of pseudo-code in whichever programming language you're familiar with.\n2) Assign each variable to an individual shift register, and figure out which nodes will require direct communication to perform conditional checks.\n3) You can minimize conditional checking by observing the inputs for the puzzle. Sometimes they fall within a certain range of values or the sequence length is limited.\n4) Read the manual thoroughly and know what JEZ JGZ JLZ JRO do because they are your best friends. \n5) When writing a sequence to a stack memory node, always consider executing the entire sequence before retrieving new values. This can be achieved by ensuring that the first node obtains a response from the rest of the program before going back to the start .\n6) All ACC and BAK values are automatically flushed and the registers reset to the initial state once a test is finished. You need not worry about being prepared for the subsequent two tests and the random tests.\n7) For image puzzles, you can write x and y coordinates which are out of bounds with no consequence.\n8) Use \"!\" to place breakpoints in order to debug your code.\n9) If you're stuck on a puzzle for too long, consider attempting the rest in order to unlock more puzzles. Sometimes you get inspirations from solving a later puzzle which can be used to solve an earlier puzzle. \n\nHappy coding and try your best to avoid getting specific puzzle hints! Most of the joy from this game comes from having a sense of individual accomplishment much like Dark Souls",

If you've already played Exapunks, loved the coding aspect, but wanted some more challenging scenarios, then TIS-100 is perfect for you.",

  "review": "A heavily atmospheric programming puzzle game. You program in an archaic language on a fictional machine known as the TIS-100, which you inherited from your now-deceased uncle. The machine's various nodes are corrupted, and it's up to you to rebuild them. The manual that comes with the game as well as the data logs left behind by your uncle leave some intrigue and incentive to push forward. Figuring out the solutions to puzzles on your own is also its own reward, since you'll feel like a genius.\n\nIf the interface seems too archaic to you, I would also recommend Human Resource Machine, which I also recently played and found to be very similar. The programming in it is very similar, while the theme and interface are completely different (and it features more of a tutorial for beginners). Alternatively, if you have already completed and enjoyed Human Resource Machine, this is absolutely the game for you.",

  "review": "Despite having only 5 hours in the game. This is one of those games where those 5 hours felt a lot longer than it should be. Almost like how work hours seem to last forever. \n\nI can only recommend this game to anyone who is highly interested in puzzles, or any programmer who wants to challenge themselves in their understanding of programming concepts. Unlike real life assembly language, the game creates some additional obstacles, which depending on your take, can go from unpleasant to being fascinating. For example the game has a fundamental challenge in which passing data between registers has a limited restriction based on where the register is located. Other obstacles included a limited count of max lines per \"module\" you can type in.\n\nAs a programmer if you can appreciate the stripping of a programming system, where certain patterns are highlighted and encouraged over what one would probably be used to. You would probably appreciate the design of the game. Despite the game adding in restrictions (which is honestly part of the puzzle) there are still many familiar concepts that one would encounter in other to solve said puzzles. Obviously the basic if statements, jumps are there, but concepts such as jump tables, creating a stack with registers are still existing things one may find themselves using to solve the puzzles. (Especially if you're going for the achievements)\n\nThat being said, the game does not seem to in any way teach any of said programming concepts. There is only a manual that provides the syntax, or more like the controls of the game. Unlike other puzzle games, there aren't really any tutorials. And the concepts one would use to solve them are quite logical and mathematical in nature, as opposed to a game like Portal 2, where the concepts are ones that most people would have a better intuition for. Which may make it a frustrating game for those who are not as well versed in the concepts used in the game, as it does no hand holding.\n\nI would consider the game to appeal to a rather limited audience, that being said. If you are part of that audience, what you could get from it, is a greater appreciation of the many systems and concepts that programming explores. Both from the lack of it in the game, because there certainly are many enhancing systems in the real world for us to solve complex problems, but also from the concepts the game chooses to explore, which are often used in the real world.",

This emulated programming environment shows a \"tough as nails\" language with parallel processing, in a comfortable learning environment. You are face increasingly difficult challenge puzzles, but you use the same dozen commands, so they become familiar.\n\nIn regards to the gameplay, most people are going to be a lot happier playing a newer Zachtronic game. The puzzles have the same feel in SpaceChem, for example. TIS-100 lacks almost all hallmarks of a video game: no music, barely any sound, the graphics are intentionally \"80s DOS\" retro, the story is narrative visible, and typing keyboard commands is the main game control. Looking through the reviews, you will see that most people who have more than a few hours in-game say they are already computer programmers.\n\nI enjoy learning assembler on an ubuntu linux desktop, with radeon mesa graphic drivers. TIS-100 uses the Unity Game Engine, and it takes up 85 MBs of diskspace. The game comes with a nicely designed 14-page manual. The game will also keep track of your steam-friends' scores, too.\n",

Having to use a manual makes it feel like more authentic, bringing back the days when you were given programming instructions for ancient computers.

  "review": "I think I may be one of the black sheep in the crowd of reviewers for this game, in the sense that I have zero computer science, coding, or programming background. So consider this an every-man perspective.\n\nThis is a game that may seem extremely intimidating at first, nearly unapproachable, but with just a LITTLE bit of patience, you'll start to understand just what this game is. This game is built around the idea that you are working on an odd government prototype computer that your recently passed uncle discovered at a yard sale. You inherit it and need to figure out what the hell it is, what it does, how it works, and how to fix it. When you boot it up, the game prompts you with the recommendation that you should read or even print out the user manual to:\nA) Help teach yourself what you're doing \nB) Ultimately save yourself some time \nand\nC) Create even more of a sense of immersion\n\nIn that regard, you REALLY should print it out and read the manual, because oddly enough, reading the manual in real life and figuring out the main menu is actually a part of the game and your first REAL puzzle. Fourth wall breaking. The immersion of this game is surprisingly impressive, and the story (hidden in files as you uncorrupt the system, left over by your uncle) adds to all of that.\n\nSo, how about the puzzles themselves? Well, think of it like you're using words (a verb and noun pair) to make lines of commands in geographically spaced out computing notes to write abstract equations to solve the puzzle each level, changing the set numeric inputs into the desired and expected outputs. In short, you are using a limited selection of recognized commands to write an equation, and do so in a limited space as efficiently as you can. Very different from anything I've ever played.\n\nThis is not my comfort zone, but still refreshing. With patience, I've been able to solve the first 5 levels, but with the difficulty ramp up (which is pretty severe, to be honest) I'm not sure how much farther I can proceed, which is why I'm taking a hiatus from the game to write this review. I'll try again after I dabble in some of the creator's other works, which I'm looking forward to trying out. \n\nAll in all, considering how cheap this game is on sale (around $1), and how unique it is, it's REALLY hard not to recommend it, just as a curiosity if nothing else. Just don't be surprised if you can't finish the game to completion. Every level completed is an accomplishment in and of itself.",

  "review": "(TLDR at bottom)\nTo preface, I'm no programmer and have done no programming prior to this game. TIS-100 lacks a guided step by step tutorial instead opting to give the user a manual that details the commands of the pseudo programming language that the player uses to control the game. This allows great immersion and lets the player feel like a person working with the language and not someone playing the game. However it also leaves you feeling confused as your not given knowledge when you need it rather all at once and are left to figure out what commands are usual for your given situation.\n\nI struggled through the first level and subsequently had to rely on a walkthrough and explanation for the next 3. Using what i learned in those hand held 3 levels I was able to apply my knowledge to the 5th level and work it out without any assistance. This was extremely rewarding for me,  I truly felt like a programmer problem solving my way to a solution, manual in hand. For this reason i recommend TIS-100.\n\n(TLDR) In short, TIS-100 has the potential to be a rewarding pseudo programming puzzler to the player that is willing to seek out information for themselves rather than be provided it in the form of a tutorial. I hope my review was helpful :)\n",

  "review": "TL;DR: this game really makes you think and can teach you some important algorithmic ideas. It will be interesting if you have some interest in programming, doesn't require special skills other than thinking and will be challenging even for those who have experience in high-level programming languages.\n\nLonger:\nWell, first of all, although it's called a \"programming game\", it doesn't require any special skills or knowledge to play it. The in-game \"manual\" is only 14 pages long, and it's enough to describe everithing you need to know. The game uses an overly simplified version of assembler (no need to know what that is) with only a dozen of instructions. If you can understand what phrases like \"moving a number from one place to another\" and \"jump to another place under a certain condition\" mean - you can play it.\n\nSurely this game will be boring if you have never had any interest in such areas. Otherwise it will not only be an interesting challenge, but also will teach you some quite important ideas about algorighms. Not just \"teach\" you by showing and explaining them, but by making you come to the realisation yourself, so that it will be in fact your own idea you came up with on your own. Solving every task means to realise some underlying idea. Like \"how do I multiply using only addition and limited memory?\", \"how do I compare numbers using only arithmetic and comparation with zero?\", etc. It's useful to know since it's close enough to how real computers do it (considering only the algorithmic part).\n\nBut it can be said about almost every game of this kind. What is so special about it? I, judging by my limited experience, can say the following. After you understand how to solve the problem, you have actually completed a mere half of the level. Yes, you got the necessary idea and created a correct program. But this program is guaranteed to be \"inefficient\", that is, taking too long to finish (look at the histograms after finishing a level, showing \"global stats\"). There are some more subtle ideas to be discovered here, about how to make it more efficient, which are also important in real life (although not all of them are applicable there due to specific architecture of the TIS-machine, see below). They are harder to get but the feeling of superiurity, which you receive after achieving the best possible result, is even better than that after killing a boss in dark souls, since it's not your reflexes who have won, but your wits. Only after that you may say \"I have finished the task completely\", only thus you get from the game everything it can offer. But later in the game this part is much more of the \"game\" side rather than the \"schoolbook\" one, since it mostly deals with \"how to use the special architecture of TIS more efficient\" instead of \"how to make the algoright itself better\".\n\nOf course having some experience in general programming (if you have never dealt with assembler) may be helpful, but it won't let you solve every puzzle in an instant, since you still have to adapt what you know into the limits of the game, including the toy-version of assembler, the limit on the number of instruction per cell, etc. Also, it's not an ordinary \"toy computer\" which you can deal with in the most of the games. The main structural difference with the real CPUs is that here you have several \"processing units\" at once, each of them commicating with the adjacent ones by direct transferring of data and each having their own program inside. So it feels like managing several simple computers at once, which completely changes the situation. There is also no any kind of RAM (just a couple of \"stack memory\" nodes later in the game), as you might have guessed already. So it still will be interesting for you. Just don't forget that it's just a game, and not a simulator. Although in the later part the tasks become impossible to solve without spending some time with pen and paper, which makes it look more like your college homework, which is another one of downsides of this game. But if that is ok with you - no obstacles for you to enjoy the game.",

  "review": "This is an okay-ish game. Please understand that this is a puzzle, not a means to learn programming. Personally i am not a puzzle guy, but the game is quite hard, so i guess it is a good puzzler.\n\nInstead, this review will focus on analyzing the programming part of the game.\n\nYou have all this box setup of 3x4. The amount of boxes available to you depends on the puzzle. Each box allows for 12 line of code. Each box has arrows from it to the adjacent boxes. That's for controlling I/O. \n\nYou get the MOV command to control I/O. Down are the 4 cases on how you can use this command.\n\nMOV 10 UP - for example moves value 10 to the box above the current one.\n\nMOV UP DOWN - takes input from the box above, and sends it to the box below itself.\n\nMOV UP ACC - takes input from the upper box, and puts it into a variable called ACC.\n\nMOV UP NIL - takes the input, and discards it.\n\nAlso, the MOV command logic requires the upper box to be free when doing MOV 10 UP for example. Same for the MOV UP DOWN, which requires the upper box to have some input waiting in there. If the necessary direction is not free, or the input is not there, the code in that box halts on that line.\n\nEach box has 2 variables called ACC and BAK, and a command to switch the values. ACC is interactable, and BAK is not. The only way to interact with BAK is to switch it.\n\nThe ALU in this language is a mess.\n\nYou have ADD and SUB.\n\nADD VALUE\n\nValue gets added to the ACC.\n\nThere is no multiplication. The closest thing you get is multiplication by 2 - ADD ACC.\n\nThis is an assembly language, so there are labels, and branch commands. The comparison operators are however a piece of work.\n\nYou get ACC == 0, ACC != 0, ACC > 0, ACC < 0.\n\nThe code is run line by line, 1 line at a time. When the box reaches the last line, it starts over. Each box has to communicate in synchrony, and that's where halting with MOV comes in for example.\n\nThere is also a branch for jumping lines, called JRO VALUE. JRO 1 will go to the next line. JRO -1 to the previous line. JRO 0 will stay on the same line, which makes it run indefinately and thus stops the execution in that box.\n\nThere is also NOP, which is a dummy command. Since the game runs code 1 line at a time, NOP is another command to synchronize the boxes.\n\nIf you wanna know more, there is a manual on this game. Just search for it on net.\n\nPersonally, i find this to be a very frustrating and limiting langauge. If this was the way programs were wrote, i wouldn't be a programmer.",

But to make it more gamy a view limitations are imposed:\n1. the only accessable storage beeing acc, meaning you can only save in one \"slot/variable/addressable space\". This is mitigated because you actually have multiple cors \"nodes\" with each one having a acc.\n2. communikation between nodes is tiresome because non blocking operations are missing.+The Instruction set is super minimal. Inifinifactory had a similar problem in my eyes: the logic was just to limiting.\n3. code is not reusable, and each node can only sore about 20 lines of code -> combined with the small storage and small instructon set this is just infuriating to me. You have a solution in mind but miss 2 lines to complete it.... now you need to start from scratch. Inifinifactory did not have that start from scratch problem. \n\nThe \"IDE\" functionality is also not as nice as i expected. No autocompletion, code navigation also not as great as Intellij ;)\n\nWhat I like about this game is that they tried. I respect Zach Barth thinking of \"new\" ideas for engineers.

  "review": "Oh yes!\n\nTIS-100 is a game where you get to program a parallel computing system in an assembly language syntax. The instruction set is easy to learn as there are only a handful of instructions. I won't say anything about the story in the game but each puzzle has a specification for what your program should do. You read from n inputs and write to m outputs. The output is tested in four runs to check if you wrote a program that appears to behave correctly. There's also a few sandbox modes where you can play around with stacks, put pixels on the screen and get rudimentary input from a console. Upon solving a puzzle you get score in three categories. The number of instructions you used, the number of nodes you used and the number of clock cycles it took to complete the task. You'll see a histogram of global scores to compare how you've done and friends will have their best scores listed numerically.\n\nSome puzzles have good replayability as they are hard to optimize. Others are quite simple and serve no replayability at all. On reddit there's a listing of records in four categories. Some of them just seem insane to beat. Sure, you might have got the optimal clock cycles down, but can you reduce the number of nodes and instructions while still keeping up with the clock cycles?\n\nFinally, there's also a possibility to write your own puzzles although there is no convenient way to share them with the world. \n\nIf there's anything I dislike with the game, well... For sandbox mode, I would really have enjoyed being able to configure so that there could be more nodes, or more instructions per node. I get it, it's about optimization and scarce resources, but it would also be fun to roam around a bit in a creative fashion. But other than that, I don't really have anything to complain about.

  "review": "This game has a very intense learning curve, so I imagine most players will be frustrated trying to get the hang of it.  That said, if you want a nice set of optimization challenges relating to information flow, this is a fantastic game to pick up.  It also serves as a good framework for building intuition about parallelized processes in the real world.\n\nThe game is played via a very constrained programming language, on a grid of nodes which each can only hold a loop of up to 15 instructions, and two values.  Nodes run in parallel, values are passed from node to node, input is converted to output, and if you match their expected output on all 4 tests you have succeeded in that challenge.\n\nThe game has a histogram for every challenge showing the best scores across all players in each category: cycles, nodes, and instructions.  There is typically a tradeoff, to use fewer cycles to generate the output you add more instructions across more nodes, and so on.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the game is the skill ceiling.  The subreddit /r/tis100 holds leaderboards that have been updated regularly since the game's inception, and people are still finding ways to make the solutions faster, more compact or more elegant.  With such a limited set of operations, the fact that there are still tricks to find and use can come as a surprise.  But it speaks well to the design of the challenges - there is just enough complexity that obvious solutions, when they even exist, don't even turn out to be the best ones.",

  "review": "Although obviously a very different game TIS-100 has some similarities with Dark Souls that I think help explain what makes it fun:\n[list]\n    [*]The problems you face don't have [i]a[/i] solution. Instead, a situation with challenging parameters and restraints is presented to you and it is up to you to struggle to find something, [i]anything[/i], that works. There is a reasonable change that the solution you find will not be one that the designer had thought of. It is almost a certainty that the solution you find will not be the best one, and part of the fun in TIS-100 is trying to figure out how to improve your solution.\n    [*]The problems you face are hard. Upon first glance some of them might seem impossible with the tools you've been given. Part of what makes it fun is that the challenge is genuine, and for me there is a similar sense of elation upon figuring out a TIS-100 puzzle as there is after beating a Dark Souls Boss: It had seemed like I would never do it, but I figured out a way, got better, and did it!\n[/list]\n\nWhile it is true that TIS-100 will likely appeal to programmers I'm not convinced that non-programmers wouldn't enjoy it. In fact, I think I would turn that statement around: If you find TIS-100 fun you would probably also enjoy programming. There are many puzzzles I've encountered in games over the years that are really programming problems, but none have been so blatant about it as TIS-100. If you are the kind of puzzle gamer who enjoys puzzles that require setting up a situation and then watching what happens when pressing GO to see if the outcome is what you expect then I would recommend giving TIS-100 a chance.",

  "review": "This game is hard to review because it fills a very specific niche, even compared to Zachtronics' usual fare. So, before proceeding in this review, I have three questions:\n\nAre you good at thinking outside the box?\nWould you buy a game if you couldn't complete it in a couple weeks after buying it?\nCan you play a game with no music, minimal sound and a bare-bones interface?\n\nIf you answered no to any of these questions, TIS-100 is not a game for you.\n\nThat out of the way, TIS-100 is still a great game. Just not for everyone. TIS-100 has 50 puzzles, each of which gives the player a goal: Take a series of numbers from up to 4 inputs, manipulate the data, and then send results to the outputs. As usual, Zach starts the player off easy, introducing concepts one at a time, and then quickly ramps up the difficulty and forces the player to test their skills with little \"down time\". Players will find themselves selecting maxes, sorting sequences, calculating mathematical operations and in the later stages even drawing onto a limited-color pixel canvas in accordance with the data.\n\nThough some puzzles are incredibly difficult, even for someone with a programmer's mind like myself, Zach gives a reprieve - the player is not required to complete every puzzle in sequence to proceed; they can cherry-pick puzzles and unlock each row one by one just by completing a certain number of segments. If a particular puzzle is too difficult, the player can just choose to come back to it later. And even after the player completes a stage, there's plenty of replay value - like other Zachtronics games, each stage gives the player metrics on their performance - how many instructions they used, how long it took the program to complete the puzzle, and nodes used. After a puzzle is completed, the player gets to see how they stacked up to the data of other players, meaning there's always room for improvement.\n\nIf you're not worried about being unable to complete the game and you enjoy racking your brain for unconventional solutions, I'd definitely reccommend TIS-100.",

If you aren't a fan of Zachtronics, this is a waste of money. If you've never played a Zachtronics game before, I would reccomend playing Infinifactory or Spacechem before this. Both are gentler introductions to the kind of problem solving you will be expected to do in this game, and are great games in their own right.\n\nIf you are a programmer, the kind that programs not because it's a living, but because you love it, and do it in your off-time for fun... disregard the above. You're almost certainly already a fan of Zachtronics, you just don't know it yet.\n\nSecondly, if you hate reading, and can't stand to read through a well-written manual, this isn't a game for you. You must read the manual. Even if you're an experienced asm programmer, I would at least reccomend it. \n\nThirdly, for you already established Zachtronics fans, note that this hews a little closer to Zach's older work than Spacechem/Infinifactory. No, it's not as brutal as The Codex or The Bureau, to say nothing of Ruckingenur or KOHCTPYKTOP, but it's definitely less self-explanatory than Spacechem, and the concepts at play are a bit harder to grasp. Not that it's harder than Spacechem: I couldn't say if any of Zach's games are harder than any other with a straight face.\n\nFinally, this is a game about writing mock assembly which is similar to real assembly but without some constructs you might expect (no bit twiddling, no pointers, no indirect addressing: Heck, there's no RAM TO addresss). If you don't know what that means, don't worry. Suffice to say that it's akin to programming on the lowest level of computer hardware. If that sounds scary, don't worry: it's not. The tools at your disposal may be more primitive than what you're used to, but at the end of the day, you're still taking a high-level idea and transforming it into a process the computer can understand. If you don't know what *that* meant, don't worry. The point is, you'll be fine.",

  "review": "A couple questions to ask if considering TIS-100:\n\n1) Am I deeply fascinated by 1970s/early 80s retrocomputing?\n2) Am I at least a little bit attracted to the idea of poring over detailed hardware/API documentation, looking for clues and tricks?\n\nIf you can answer yes to these questions, TIS-100 is soooo going to be your jam. \n\nThis is very likely the nerdiest game I have ever played. It simulates a fictional multicore computer (loosely inspired by the Connection Machine), provides you with a list of \"diagnostic tasks\" (puzzles/challenges), with nothing but the friendly manual for company. The TIS is programmed through a simple assembly language, with only room for a small number of instructions in memory. It doesn't take long before the puzzles force you to optimize and get tricky, and in doing so you'll get some experience with real-world programming concepts like process synchronization and I/O blocking. The game is also a pretty good intro to assembly language in general, and how computers work at the chip level on a simple architecture.\n\nBeyond the specific mechanics of the puzzles, TIS-100 has a lot in common with other Zachtronics games. Like Spacechem and Infinifactory, most of the puzzles are some variation of \"you receive something from an input node, do some operations on it, send it to the proper output node as efficiently as possible,\" which is a good template with endless room for variation. Like those other games, your solutions are graded on various metrics and a lot of the fun is in optimizing your creations to compete against your friends on the in-game leaderboards.\n\nThis is the least flashy and least mainstream Zachtronics game, but if you enjoy programming and weird old computers, it's pretty amazing.",

  "review": "This review will be divised in two parts: for programmers and for non-programmers. But first, let me just answer quickly two questions: no, you don't need to know how to program to play this game (though it would help), and no, it won't teach you how to program (in assembly or otherwise). \n\nFor programmers:\nYou love programming? You don't program just as a job, but also as a hobby? You love writing useless yet challenging programs? You love doing competitive programming (Project Euler, Hackerrank, Codingame...)? You just couldn't get enough of this system hardware/assembly class? Then this is the game for you! However, don't be fooled; even though your skills will come handy, this game has little to do with assembly, and is even very different from programming. It's very \"spatial\": you have data going from one chip to the other, with each chip having its own code (that you write) that tells it how to deal with the data. There's one register by chip, and only a dozen of instructions. This has almost nothing to do with anything you've done before.\n\nFor non-programmers:\nThe game may look complicated and/or boring, but don't be afraid: fun comes from the solutions you find to the problems, it just doesn't need an elaborate presentation. Also, if you've never programmed before, it won't prevent you from enjoying it. Your learning curve will certainly be a little bit slower than a programmer's one, but if you're able to read, think logically and compute, you've got everything to succeed. There's a manual included in the game. It's a couple of pages and you have to read it carefully, but so would anyone since it's an invented programming language. If you have patience and enjoy mathematical or logical puzzles, this might be a very enjoyable experience for you! It will be very novel and hardcore, but if some people enjoy Dark Souls, I don't see why non-programmers (aka Muggles) wouldn't enjoy TIS-100 (not to say that this is anything comparable). However, I've said it before and I'll repeat it: this will NOT teach you how to code. At best, it will teach you how to think like a programmer, but there are better resources to do so (like Scratch, which is free and understandable for anyone, even a 6 years-old kid).",

  "review": "TIS-100 is a great game by Zachtronics of SpaceChem fame.\n\nIt's probably the ugliest looking game I've played in decades. I mean Pong ugly. But the game itself is so brilliant, you get so absorbed in it, that you stop even noticing the aesthetics.\n\nOn the surface, TIS-100 is about assembly programming. On each level you are given a programming task: read this sequence and find the max; read these two numbers and divide one by the other, finding the quotient and remainder; etc. Most of these tasks would be trivial in any modern programming language.\n\nThe challenge comes from the computational model. What you have to work with is some number of processing nodes, some of which are connected to each other, which allows primitive message passing. Each node is extremely limited: it only has two registers, and can't even work with both at the same time; one is a backup register and can't be the source or target of arithmetic operations. This means that even simple tasks take ingenuity to perform. On top of that, each node only fits 15 lines of code, which means you have to squeeze computation out of every command.\n\nIn most levels you only have some network of processing nodes, so in effect what you have is a deterministic finite automaton (although with a huge number of states). In some you have one \"stack memory\" node, i.e. a pushdown automaton. In only a few do you have two stack nodes, which makes for a Turing-complete system. (And, appropriately, one programming task in such a level is sorting. It is well-known that pushdown automata can't do general sorting.) Actually what I just said doesn't exactly capture the computer science at play, since the very limited instruction set makes for additional restrictions. It's an interesting theory problem to model and understand the TIS-100 computers more fully!\n\nI don't think someone totally untrained in CS can finish this game. But if you do know some of the standard ideas and/or are used to modern programming languages, TIS-100 is an excellent way to think outside the usual patterns and explore how surprisingly powerful even very weak models of computation can be.\n\nThere's a story in the background too which I thought was well done.",

As you're given very few commands, and a limited input space for them to be executed, TIS-100 challenges you to perfect your code, *just to complete the level as-is*, not to mention improving it further and further to compete with others online.\n\nI will say the game can be *incredibly* difficult at times.

I have done some programming before(really random training stuff) and as such TIS-100 very much felt like stuff I have done before, as opposed to Spacechem or Infinifactory that feel fresh.\n\nNow that said TIS-100 was plenty fun enough to (mostly)go through escpecially thanks to the early learning curve with the manual and such. But this was the first and last game that, for me, gets away with just using a simplified programming language for math puzzles. I know I have been and will continue to ignore Human Resource Machine because of this for example. If you have played that one prior you might still get quite a bit out of TIS-100 since this is a significantly harder game(from what I have seen), but be aware that the early/mid game stuff is going to be a whole lot of the same/similar math problems.",

  "review": "Although this game may have a steep learning curve compared to many others, the challenge of completing various \"simple\" tasks in a stripped-down assembly language is incredibly enthralling. What most programming languages can accomplish in a single line of code (e.g. multiplication, division) may require two-to-three dozen instructions in this game. On its face, this concept sounds quite dull, but after working through the first few puzzles, you will find that it is pure magic. Each task stretches the brain immensely, and indeed, some of the later tasks may take several hours of thinking, programming, and debugging to solve. This perseverance ultimately rewards you with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound insight into the lowest-level workings of a computer.\n\nTo break much of the tedium of programming for hours on end, the game supplies an intriguing backstory into the nature of the TIS-100 computer system, communicated through several journaled entries by the previous owner of the fictional machine. My only gripe is that this story, despite all of its potential, simply does not provide enough depth to be satisfying. Whereas well-developed stories weave into the game seamlessly, motivating the player to continue playing in order to reveal more of the plot, this one seems more like a sideshow or distraction. Fortunately, the problems themselves are enticing enough to make TIS-100 a time-worthy game.\n\nAlthough programmers may have an easier time adjusting to the practice of writing pseudo-assembly code, those without coding experience need not be intimidated by the game. Zachtronics did an excellent job keeping the language itself as simple as possible, while still crafting complex problems with multiple possible solutions. I would genuinely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles that require deep thinking, programmers with an interest in low-level code, and individuals who revel in finding more efficient solutions to problems they have already solved.",

I got addicted hard to this game, and even though I was terrible I just kept at it until I persevered. If you're the kind of person who gets obsessed, you'll definitely get your money's worth here.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI hated playing this game at first. Not because it was bad, but because I was really bad at it. I had absolutely zero prior programming experience. I couldn't even solve the first few puzzles on my own. But something about it just made me keep playing. Once you get the hang of the instructions it becomes really addicting.\nI still probably won't be able to beat the game, but I've enjoyed the hours I've gotten out of it, and the few satisfying moments when I finally cracked a hard puzzle.\nIf you enjoy a difficult challenge then I recommend it, whether you know how to code or not.\n\nP.S. I just thought I'd also mention that you can get jump commands from other nodes by using JRO <direction>. They didn't explain that very well in the manual and I spent half the game using a more convoluted amalgamation of JMP, JLZ, and JGZ instructions. Also F1 brings up a shorter version of the manual on the screen so you don't have to keep tabbing out to look at it",

This game will tax your logic and reasoning to it's limit. For a while at least (more on this later)\n\nI'll not spoil the excellent little plot line that runs throughout the game, lets just say there is one.\n\nI have some knowledge of programming and scripting, but I've never used assembly before even though I've experienced it's usage. It is arguably the most beautiful language known to man. Even in it's more modern forms like x86_64. Especially if you've ever touched hex-code...*shudders*\n\nYou DONT need ANY programming experience whatsoever to enjoy this. \n\nThere are a handful of instructions that you can input to a node and you'll have memorised those by the end of the third puzzle. You will however need to play with them a bit to fully understand how the nodes cycle and what will cause a halt. I must say, despite being rather authentic, the manual doesn't really serve the same function a real manual for a machine of this type. There just isn't enough information about data flow and cyclic processes. This doesn't matter though, a few trial and error attempts at the first tricksy little puzzleses and you'll break through that wall. \n\nThis game will get into your head. Because the language is  so natural and simple, you'll start devising programs and sequences while you're at your real job, doing real work, with real code. Just to finish that puzzle that stumped you the evening before.\n\nI must reiterate that this is something anyone can play. You might be scratching your head by the 6th puzzle, but just keep your wits about you and you'll be able to do it. The payoff is a fantastic feeling of satisfaction we often don't get anymore. If you're unsure about how computers actually work and process information, this is a very good starting point to understand it, too!\n\nTwo thumbs up to the devs, stirling job.\n\nWish List!\n-Ambent fan and HDD noise, display hum?

I feel that the assembly language can be very limiting at times (only 15 lines allowed), and I'm used to using way more than 2 registers (only one of which can be directly accessed) in real assembly programming, so it's pretty challenging. But, it's challenging in a pretty fun way, and the way the computing nodes work mean that you can use other nodes as extra registers, caches or for more complex architectural things like pipelining (instruction-level parallel processing) or a multiprocessor system (albeit a very limited one).\n\nGame is pretty short, but still worth the money in my opinion.",

It is much like programming in real assembly language, but more simplified and somwhat modularized to allow people unfamiliar with assembly programming to get the hang of it.  I would definately love to see more games like this as i feel it can really peak an interest in any aspiring programmers and build a solid foundation for real world applications.  \n\nI would like to reiterate, it is a segnificantly dumbed down form of assembly language, but I feel this game does have some very strong educational roots and can help players develop a foundation for programming.  \n\nThe game itself has a steep learning curve but provides an incredibly fun and unique challenge to the player, requiring lots of logical thinking.  I also like that the game does not have a 1 puzzle 1 solution model, it looks for the right answer not the right way to acheive the answer, witch is fundimental in real world programming.  There is no one true way to accomplish anything when programming and I beleive this game really does a good job of playing on that aspect.  \n\nOverall I want to say this game is worth more than its price tag, especially if your into programming or logical challenges.  at times some puzzles can become stressful when you cant figure out how to solve one, but the game allows you to select from multiple avalible puzzles, preventing you from being hung up on a single puzzle and not being bale to progress.",

TIS-100 is a programming-themed puzzle game of the same ilk, by which I mean it gives you a goal and tools and lets you figure out how you want to solve it. Will you go for least number of cycles spent, making your solution the most time/resource efficient? Or will you go for the solution that uses the fewest lines? Maybe you'd rather a more balanced solution? If you liked SpaceChem, chances are very good you'll like this.\n\nOne thing I like about TIS-100 is that instead of feeding you story in between levels, it's hidden in the manual and \"corrupted\" nodes for you to suss out as you go along. It really adds to the exploratory feeling you get from their recommendation that you print out the manual and the note on the front of the manual that sets the game up as being you tinkering with a dead relative's unfinished computer project.\n\nI'm really happy with this game.",

The debugger is quite useful and the limited architecture can make even simple tasks complex, which suits a puzzle game just fine.

Sometimes you can make a change that you think should improve times significantly only to see them go up because of a bottleneck you didn't notice. Sometimes you'll just be optimizing for size and stumble on something that speeds it up as well. \n\nAs far as the arch goes for real world applications, it does leave some stuff to be desired, there's several very simple tweaks that could be done to make things more efficient without adding much more silicon. However, since it's a game and not meant to be used for serious tasks, that's OK.

  "review": "An incredibly fun game, if programming a group of up to 12 nodes that each only has two registers is your cup of tea.  It sure is mine.  As a straight up warning, if logic puzzles aren't your thing, this game will be a drag for you.  \n\nYou will need to read the manual.  There's no tutorial, and there is no in-game help.   Knowledge of actual assembler is helpful, but not required.  The ability to think logically and enjoy stepping through your program to see exactly what it's doing are requirements, however.\n\nFor each challenge, you are given your problem statement: take in data in this format, perform this operation, output this result.  You are given sample input data, and the expected output you would need to provide.  When you feel your program is ready, you run it, it's given the sample input data, and the output is checked against the expected.  If your program produces correct output, you pass -- if it produces incorrect output, the discrepancies are noted and you'll have to fix your program.\n\nThe challenge comes from the fact that the computer ostensibly running your program is laughably limited: 12 nodes, each of which has 2 registers (ACC and BAK) and can only contain 15 lines of code.  Op codes are exceedingly primitive as well: you only get 13 (no operation, move data, swap data, save data, add, subtract, negate, jump, jump if equal to zero, jump if greater than zero, jump if less than zero, and jump a number of lines).  At the higher levels, synchronizing communication between the nodes becomes an additional difficulty. \n\nIf the idea of implementing multiplication within these limitations intrigues you, you just might like this game.\n\nFinally, your program is graded on three criteria: number of nodes used, number of instructions used, and number of cycles used.  When it completes successfully, you'll be compared against the aggregate of those before you, which means even after you complete a problem successfully, you can be inspired to figure out smaller, faster ways of doing the task.\n\nThere's a minor backstory that's given in the flavor of the manual, and with most of the puzzles, but it's very small.\n",

I can\u00b4t recommend it as to the fact that it could have been so much more.\nDon\u00b4t get me wrong, the game is fun. It shows how much fun you can actually have with numbers and how interesting computer science (coding) can actually be. But it reaches it\u00b4s limits on what it can do way too quickly, leaving you with only the thought of what could have been possible.\nAnd what also needs to be said, is the lack of any kind of tutorial. Sure the game tries to introduce you to it\u00b4s mechanics by starting with very simple levels, tho having to open a pdf to read through pages of (for most people) irritating stuff might not appeal to everyone.\n\nSo what is TIS-100? Well it is basically the same as programming tho it extremely restricts you by either limiting the amount of commands you have at your disposal or limiting the amount of lines you can write per module.\nHaving to shorten your label names just so you can write them in the same line as another command should not have been a design choice and should not be something you will need to do. It can be extremely frustrating when your solution takes one more line of code than the module can take, making the game simply not accept your solution. For me, the biggest flaw this game has.\n\nNow maybe some or a lot of people will disagree with me not to recommend this game, but to the person considering to buy it:\nYou appear interested in the game as you read this negative review and the fact that you are still reading is enough for me to say: just buy it.\nYou will have fun and enjoy the game but if you\u00b4re looking for more i can honestly only recommend programming...\n\nEDIT after 3 years:\nI now no longer in any way recommend this game. If you are thinking about picking this up, go grab \"exapunks\" instead (same developer). It is exactly what tis-100 tries to be and is everything it could have been, maybe even more. Go check exapunks out, you won`t regret it!\n\nPS: If you were wondering: yes, programming will need some more time to get into, but as described here, it yields so much more possibilities. This game is a good start to see if you are interested in such logical thinking. If you really are, who knows, maybe taking that extra step and writing your first own programs will be worth it.\nPSS: If you\u00b4re looking for some tasks (basically what the game gives you at the start of each level) i can give you some pretty interesting ones, some of which are actually pretty hard to think through. Those lessons will get you into programming (and into some deeper stuff if you\u00b4re a non beginner). Just message me that you\u00b4re interested and we work out the details.\nThis offer only counts for Java.",

To be clear, though, for those programmers out there: this game is a puzzle game first and an assembly language simulator second. Many features you might expect from an assembly language are absent here. That's not a bad thing, however. This makes the game more approachable for those who haven't programmed in assembly, or are relatively new to programming in general. I'd imagine that even non-programmers could figure this out without much trouble if they come at it with the same mindset as SpaceChem. Those who have some experience in assembly should feel right at home. \n\nLike SpaceChem, this game encourages an almost obsessive drive to optimize to reduce cycle counts, part usages, etc. The manual that is included (and that it suggests you print out) is probably the nerdiest thing ever, and I love it! It reminds me of some manuals like the Apple 1 and 6502 manuals from the 70s-80s. The manual is quite a bit sparse, though, with several pages left almost completely blank except for a brief header. I'm not sure if these are pages are left to take notes on or if they're going to be filled out more as the game leaves early-access. There are also far fewer puzzles than SpaceChem at the time of writing. There are tools for users to create their own puzzles, but I hope that more puzzles are added as the game develops.

One TIS-100 program includes code for each different \"node\" within the system. Regular processing nodes can pass data between them using registers, and each node has just two internal registers not used for passing values. There are also memory nodes wchich store data in a stack.\nThe format of numbers within the TIS-100 is very strange: values are from -999 to 999, which must require at least 12 bits but wastes one bit. It is impossible to do bitwise operations on these values. Additionally, there is no support for input or output of text characters within programs, but the OS does this somehow.",

The interface uses both the keyboard and a pointer. The interface doesn't require great precision with the pointer, but it does require entering a fair bit of text. There are no vital sound-only cues. No lines are voiced; all dialogue is presented in text. Only the puzzles involving the graphics module rely solely on color for identification; specfically, there's a single shade of red in addition to white, black, and two greys.

The trick here is that you have to write your solution in an extremely constrained assembly language (just a handful of instructions) and with only one general purpose register. Oh and code blocks can only be 10 instructions long. There are SO many constraints, you will basically have to create Rube Goldberg machines to win. You have to MacGuyver your way to success every time. The ONLY solution is an ugly hack, and the optimal solution is probably a REALLY ugly hack. When you reach a solution, you will feel smart. Hell let's face it, if you can do it you ARE smart. If you're not, solve them with a friend maybe.\n\nThe challenge of this game starts out easy, but by about the ninth or tenth puzzle (out of about 20 currently) I was seriously stumped. Luckily you can skip a level and come back to it!\n\nI've written in assembly for microcontrollers and x86, both in college and for work. This game will not teach you any employable skill and is not a teaching tool.

If you've messed with any kind of assembly (I tinkered briefly with Core Wars and then gave up) it's very simple to pick up at least the first ten or so challenges, and I imagine even if you haven't it becomes pretty clear, the architecture is quite simple, but entertaining. Definitely has the fun of programming in a very limited environment!\nAlso, linux support! Playing this on CENTOS 7.",

  "review": "Just picked this up and having a BLAST. I enjoyed their earlier game, SpaceChem and this is an assembler programming-inspired counterpart to that chemistry-inspired game. As with SpaceChem, this is a puzzle game for people who want a challenge.\n\nThe documentation (PDF file in game directory, prompted when starting the game) is required reading, and is useful to keep in a separate window for the first few segments. You can use F1 in-game to open a quick reference that shows all instructions.\n\nPrior assembly or programming experience can be useful, but only for giving you experience in thinking in small logical steps.\n\nIf you are unsure about the game, I have a Youtube series going where I explain the puzzles in the game in a relatively accessible way, aimed at new players who got stuck. This is also a pretty decent way to see if you would like the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yZPagN5lC8&list=PLPo00Kvl9Ha2L-p3FzG9_Kdi8UyjVQTPD&index=1",

  "review": "Ever programmed assembly language? You will *love* TIS-100. Yes, you will type CODE in this game. Easy code, but it's code nonetheless, like MOV and SWP and SAV and so on. \n\nBecause you're trying to \"test\" this machine with bazillion little processors... by writing little programs in little CPUs, and the little CPUs have to talk to each other. Instead of rotating shapes and link atoms, you're moving numbers and popping registers and moving them through ports. \n\nAnd yes, this is intentionally looking like messing with the 80 column text days, And before you ask, yes, there's a meta game... you're trying to figure out the origin of this piece of hardware... by unlocking more bits of the little CPUs, dump the microcode, and solve the mystery... \n\nIf you understand the concept of registers (and it's rather simple to visualize, but there's always a debugger to help you), then this game is a lot of fun. Though being Early Access, this doesn't have the solution site like SpaceChem but it's probably getting there soon. \n\nAnd this is VERY good exercise for people who intend to get into computer hardware engineering. \n\nHighly recommended... if you dig this genre.",

Assembly knows all the gang signs. Assembly has a motorcycle, and wears the leathers everywhere, and never wears a helmet, because that would mess up Assembly's punked-out hair. Assembly likes to give cops the finger and grin and speed away. Mention that you'd like something, and Assembly will pretend to ignore you; the next day, Assembly will bring you one, no questions asked, and toss it to you with a you-know-you-want-me smirk that makes your heart race. Where did Assembly get it? \"It fell off a truck,\" Assembly says, putting away the boltcutters. You start to feel like Assembly doesn't know the meaning of \"private\" or \"protected\": what Assembly wants, Assembly takes. This excites you. Assembly knows how to get you anything but safety. Assembly will give you anything but commitment. In the end, you'll leave Assembly, not because you want something better, but because you can't handle the intensity. Assembly says \"I'm gonna live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse,\" but you know that Assembly can never die, not so long as Assembly is still the fastest thing on the road.",

  "review": "TIS-100 is an assembly programming puzzle game which requires no previous knowledge of programming (meaning everything you need to know is explained in the manual). Once you start the game, you actually just virtually start up the TIS-100 machine (e.g. you'll get a boot screen and the like).\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, the game is entirely text-based, but the beauty of the game lies in what happens in your mind. Zachtronics managed to keep things interesting from the outset, hinting at a mystery lying somewhere in the machine and prompting you to print out the manual as first thing (something I truly encourage, too).\n\nThe TIS-100 architecture is made up of several different nodes (small square panels). You generally get some values as input and you have to handle/modify them in order to obtain the required output. As in SpaceChem, there are of course several limitations which will hamper your task: each node can contain up to 16 lines of code, you must synchronize the communication over the port between nodes... you get the picture.\n\nI played through 6 levels, and things are beginning to get spicy. I'm perfectly aware that this game \"isn't for everyone\" but what Zachtronics game was? If you liked SpaceChem and are interested in low level programming, you'll fall in love with this game. If you haven't tried SpaceChem and are unsure if pure programming might appeal to you in the long run, I would suggest starting off with SpaceChem or Infinifactory, before moving on to TIS-100, because they probably feel more \"fun\" in the traditional sense of the word.\n\nTL;DR If you are interested in low level/assembly programming, this game will probably be a great way to have fun with it. :)",

After reading the manual more closely, I got a few more.  I anticipate with a little more tinkering, I can get even further.\n\nIt's a fun game that doesn't exactly teach you programming, but you learn a bit anyway.
