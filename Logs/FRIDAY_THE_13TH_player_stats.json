  "review": "[b]Overall Rating: 4/5[/b]\n\n[b]Gameplay: 5/5 [/b]\nFriday the 13th: The Game offers two distinct gameplay experiences. You can either take on the role of a counselor and work as a team to thwart Jason, or play as the iconic horror villain himself and stop the counselors before they escape. The counselor role is slightly more varied, with each character providing unique stats and styles of play (running, stealth, fighting back, focusing on objectives, etcetera). Playing as Jason is entertaining as well, with a number of different \"Jasons\" to pick from (each corresponding with a different film in the franchise).\n\nThe game has a lot of replayability - the variety of counselors, perks, maps and ways to play mean it doesn't get boring. With that being said, F13 is definitely more fun with friends, I'd recommend maybe buying with a group of people to play with for the best experience.\n\n[b]Graphics and Atmosphere: 4/5[/b]\nThe graphics are of a good quality and the animations are generally smooth. The environment feels pretty immersive, particularly on the darker and rainy maps.\n\n[b]Performance: 3/5[/b]\nOn the whole performance is decent. Occasional bugs do crop up but tend not to massively interfere with the experience. The most noticeable issue the game suffers from is a lack of players. Unfortunately the playerbase has dwindled since release and while it is possible to find matches, queue times can be long. Private matches are an option though which easily overcomes this problem if you have friends to play with.\n\n[b]Recommendation: Worth full price.[/b]",

  "review": "The problem is that, like in the similarly structured Evolve, you can\u2019t choose to be Jason. One player is chosen at random at the start of the match, and with up to eight players that means there is a 12.5% chance of you being Jason. You can set your preference to play Jason in the settings, but the other day I played all day long and only got to be Jason once.\nSo you spend the vast majority of your time as a teenager, which isn\u2019t nearly as satisfying to play. On this side of the conflict, you have four survival options: escape by car, escape by boat, call the cops to come rescue you, or survive the night. The first three methods require finding key items in order to repair the escape route, but the items are spread across the partially randomized map randomly. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any rhyme or reason as to how the items are distributed, so playing as a teen means just searching every drawer of every room in every cabin. That\u2019s just not a very interesting activity, even while being hunted. The lucky jerk who gets to be Jason is out there having all the fun while you\u2019re rummaging through desks! You can hide in an outhouse or whack Jason with a weapon to stun him, but these mostly just buy you time. There is a multistep process for actually killing Jason that is smartly tied to the movies, but it will require a lot of coordination between you and your fellow teens.\nThis is definitely a game where communication is key if you want to survive. The important items you need to find are so arbitrarily spread out, happening upon them all on your own is unlikely. Players on headsets will be able to let others know they\u2019ve found the car engine, and if a couple others have the gas and keys you can all rendezvous at the escape vehicle.\nWhile there is a lot of welcome attention to franchise details, Friday the 13th is not a polished game. In fact, it\u2019s quite buggy. Collision detection is terrible, and it\u2019s not uncommon to see characters popping through walls, teens hovering in the air, and corpses still flailing about after Jason has ended them. Each teen has a few lines of dialogue, but their mouths don\u2019t move when speaking. And every single match begins with the same shot of the preppy teen\u2019s ridiculous face, which gets old fast.",

Honestly, it\u2019s great, graphics are pretty good (you cant really see anything anyway lol) and the gameplay is pretty great as well. Just I feel as if Jason is to underpowered, especially compared to the movies, his stun time takes forever and the counselors can get away to easily without barely a scratch. Only one time have I ever killed all 8 counselors, but it was only because 4 of them were in a car and we\u2019re panicking and not running away and the others were running around trying to get supplies. Jason is also fairly slow, which is understandable just sometimes with the car it\u2019s really annoying how you can\u2019t stop the people when their in reverse (you might be able to but I have never). Honestly other than that it\u2019s pretty good, only once have I had to deal with hackers but it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. Game is great and I personally love it and like to play it all the time, if you like gore, suspension, and darkness in a game then this is for you.

Mind you it's a beautiful concept of a game that got killed because of a legal lawsuit during the midst of its heydays. There were also loads of hackers, bugs, The AI generally had the brain of a chicken.....(Yes, even on hard difficulty for singleplayer). There are some pros though to this game as well. You can still play P2P but I recommend gathering a group of friends who have the game or making some friends who have the game to play with. There's also the singleplayer mode where you can go up against the AI on several iconic F13 Maps. There's also a load of iconic Jasons you can play as, as well as Camp counselors. I just in my right mind cannot though give this game a positive rating for the condition it is currently in. I would say to save your money for another game that's more worth it and actively has updates going on. Oh yeah, There's no more updates for this game. Look forward to what Gun Media may be coming out with involving Myers though. Spend your money on that! Can't wait to see you all there in the next Gun Media game though!!!!",

  "review": "Playing a movie accurate Jason tends to leave a better lasting impression, and partly attributed to the effective use of stalk. An ability that allows Jason to move silently and disable the musical cue, which would otherwise alert nearby counselors to his presence. Nothing shocks unwary players more than opening a cabin door just to find Jason grabbing them by the throat.  Suddenly appearing in the middle of the road immediately sends driving players into reverse to hilarious effect. More so if the car breaks down upon collision.\n\nPrimal fear is translated quite well into gameplay mechanics. Accumulating fear decreases motor function, the loss of blood flow to the muscle causes running counselors to stumble. Whimpering while in hiding. At max level, the counselor becomes hysterical with reduced stamina regeneration and lights up like a christmas tree for Jason to see.\n\nThat being said, I had my fair share of thrilling experiences playing as counselor. Being the only remaining survivor and barely escaping by the skin of your teeth is one of its best moments. All in all, extremely suspenseful gameplay, a good visual representation of the film. Devs managed to bring Crystal lake to life for players to experience. Unfortunately there's no developer support anymore. The creators of Friday the 13th filed a lawsuit on the devs putting this game into a standstill.",

  "review": "Alright, here's the deal:\n\nYes, this game is a glitchy mess.\nYes, this game will crash.\nYes, this game will probably never have new content again due to legal issues.\n\nWhen you look at some really cult horror, your eyes must rest on the Friday 13 series. A bloody rampage, in which a shapely lunatic with a covered face and a bunch of teenagers thinking only of sex play a role. Since its premiere in 1980, the film has had a number of sequels, TV series, books, etc. Given the immense popularity of the theme, it is surprising that the material has not seen more video game adaptations - only two. In 1989 and this year in the form of Friday the 13th: The Game, where you and other players get the main role. This is a third person survival game with asymmetric multiplayer. You probably already know that on one side there is a bloodthirsty Jason Voorhees, on the other side there are teenagers who will try to survive his rage.\n\n[b]Jason's rampage[/b]\n\nAsymmetric multiplayer means different abilities. Jason moves slowly, but he balances his numerical and speed disadvantages with several special abilities, the vast majority of which are very interesting, especially when you learn to use them correctly. Jason's ability to move, whether at shorter distances or anywhere on the map, helps Jason catch up.\n\nBasically, you can be in a pretty remote place in a second, which contributes to the feeling of insurmountability of the killer character and to building tension in all survivors. As soon as Jason, even if only by chance, approaches another player, the tempo of the music changes accordingly, until a chill runs down the man's back. But back to Jason.\n\nThe other two abilities are the senses, which help Jason orient himself in dark places (something like a flashlight), or better locate his victims. All special abilities have their cooldown, in addition, they are activated gradually in the game so that the survivors have a little advantage. In addition to special abilities, Jason can also use traps and throwing knives, which slows down his victims and increases his chances of \"arriving\".\n\nThe killer, who controls the game well, can then play nicely with his victims. It offers the possibility to turn off the light inside the quarters, where the hidden player is currently located, you can also walk around the closet, from where the poor victim is looking at you, or you can move behind her back. This is interesting not only from the point of view of active players, but also of already deceased individuals who can observe what is happening in the same way as in other online games.\n\n[b]Teenagers can spin it[/b]\n\nPlaying behind teenagers is a bit easier in the sense that you basically just have to hide well and press the button to hold your breath at the right time. Then, with a little luck, Jason can't locate you, and therefore can't kill you. But being hidden for long minutes and not moving is exciting so maybe for the first time. Fortunately, there are other ways to win.\n\nFirst of all, you can call the police and get to them when they arrive. You can also put a car or a boat into operation, for example. That means finding a flashlight, gasoline and a key, installing and refilling everything, and then driving some distance to safety. However, you make certain sounds that Jason can pick up, so you're basically more fragile, at least if you can't handle a few basic options, such as sneaking in or hitting Jason, which stops for a few moments.\n\nIf you decide to actively fight, it is quite interesting to cooperate, however, the game has not yet balanced the cooperation. At least not as it should. Leaving aside the obligatory situation, when you get completely out of the party, a second extreme can occur. If the whole gang stays together and pounces on Jason with weapons, Jason usually won't even cross. Needless to say, the game loses its charm in such a situation.\n\nAn exception may be an extremely capable player, but I have not met that in the game yet. In addition, stronger players exaggerate a bit with godliness, so when you wait for a new sword, you have to hold out until the last seconds of the game, or jump out of the game and log in to another game. Sometimes it delays unnecessarily, but that's the fate of these online games.\n\n[b]One on one[/b]\n\nI must admit that the game has a relatively fast start. Without learning anything, in two games you are at the peak of your strength and you have a relatively good time. However, although the creators tried to revive it with various badges, achievements or perks that you can equip the victims with (higher running speed, higher car speed, starting the game with the first aid kit, etc.), all the magic disappears relatively quickly.\n\nIt is true that the creators operated only with a limited budget, which they collected through Kickstarter. However, it is also true that there could have been a little more possibility. A total of three maps, three main destinations, and that's it. Even the game environment is relatively austere. Except for a few weapons, items and drawers, you won't touch anything. You can only hide in the closet or under the bed. By that I mean that if you want to play this game today and every day, you will soon get into outrageous boredom. But if you turn on this game once every two years, you will have a royal fun.\n\nIt's also worth saying that we should look forward to a single-player game during the summer. However, since the game still suffers from some technical problems (for example, the trap levitates two meters from the ground, the character's teeth stick out of the mouth, as if he had no faces, etc.), the question is whether the release will not be delayed yet. In any case, the date has not yet been officially announced\n\nVerdict:\nA faithful rendition of the cult series. The entertainment is almost instant, but it also fades just as quickly. If there were more options and environments, one might last longer. But who knows. Pretty good for a few games, but you don't come back that often. The impression is spoiled by weaker graphics and technical processing.\n\n[h1][b]6/10[/b][/h1]\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/438740/Friday_the_13th_The_Game/",

  "review": "I'm going to recommend this game based on overall design and game play.  The attention to detail in the maps are simply stunning!  A lot of care went into getting everything right about the main cabins and houses and very good extrapolation for the outlying areas.  \n\nThe most obvious comparison is with Dead by Daylight.  I've always felt F13 was a better designed game, especially for the counselors.  You're in better control of your own destiny and there are multiple objectives to complete an escape.  Playing as Jason requires A LOT more skill than Dead by Daylight killers because in the latter, you can accumulate perks and add ons that will do the work for you.  Every Jason has the same powers but each one does them differently.  Some better, some worse.  \n\nWhat Dead by Daylight gets right is the lobbies.  Picking Jason from the public pool of players led to team killing and more trolling which helped drive away the initial player base.  Blame can be placed on the lawsuit all day if you like but looking at the data tells the real story.  The game's players declined sharply in July 2017, two months after initial release.  Not coincidentally that's when team killing began and gained a lot of traction.  Also having proximity chat as a default setting was a mistake.  Online games are filled with degenerate, hapless, maladjusted jerks that are very desperate for attention and validity.\n\nUnfortunately with the players all but gone, what's left is the unskilled, useless trolls.   You really need 8 of your friends for a private match to actually enjoy the game.  Still, in the condition that it's in, it's still better than Dead by Daylight.",

  "review": "Friday the 13th: The Game is one of the more recognizable titles in the \"asymmetric survival horror\" genre that has become popular in recent years. The Friday the 13th universe is an obvious choice for a game in this genre, so obvious that there isn't the slightest need to explain why.\n\nWhen you get a good lobby for the game, it's actually fun and challenging. But if you find yourself in a toxic lobby, the experience falls apart quite quickly. The ratio seems to skew in the latter direction from time to time, unfortunately. (April 2021 Update: It got worse.)\n\nMost importantly: There seems to be an ongoing legal dispute over the game, and that has both handicapped multiplayer (public server hosting legality) and crippled ongoing development. Which is sad, really. Lawyers and entertainment industry egos really are a bunch of bastards. (April 2021 Update: It got worse.)\n\nThe game itself has become frustrating to play, and the developers more or less indicated that even if the lawsuit is (ever) settled in their favor, they're not going to have any resources to throw out this game. It's not in a good state, and it will never get better.\n\nI tried to log in today to finish the Virtual Cabin, for the achievement and to see the franchise trivia. It seemed like a cool thing when I checked it out previously. Unfortunately I couldn't get the game to load. EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) was apparently uninstalled on my system. I reinstalled it, and the game still crashed when starting up. I'm not going to bother trying to reinstall it from scratch, just to explore the Virtual Cabin, however cool it is.\n\nThis was a great game ruined by some bullshit. Maybe the developers can let this game go to a mod community for free, so they can run with it and see what they can come up with. Excepting that, I'm done with this game.\n\nRating: D-",

  "review": "Alright, I have re-written this review many times because I don't even know how I feel about it.\nThis is going to be a MIXED review!\n\nHere's a pro's and con's list.\n\nPros:\n1) The game is actually enjoyable to play! Jason and the camp counselors are fun to play, the kills are unique and each counselor has their own perks. I think my 300 hours show you how much I enjoy it.\n2) The graphics are beautiful! Sure, the graphics have a few flaws, but coming from an indie game... they look really good! Is enjoyable to look and and makes the game more real and scary!\n3) Each gameplay is different and challenging, what kind of game is it if it has no challenge? Every round is different and fun. The game is also very challenging which is fun.\n\n(I'm not a big fan of the pro's list but its 12 am here for me and I'm tired, most likely gonna fix it later)\n\nCons:\n1) Hack... lobbies... everywhere! Clicking quick play is a nightmare! Sometimes you get a real match and sometimes its a lobby with 100 players and then 50 Jasons! (Thats not how the game is meant to be played obv) I personally do not play quick play because I hate the amount hack lobbies there is. The lobbies also max out your level which give the player the feeling of no accomplishment at all. I play offline bots and sometimes private matches because quick play is a nightmare. (I have tried it today and it seems like it got worse.)\n2) Peer to Peer connections. Ever since the game got sued and is now basically left to rot, the developers decided to make the lobbies peer to peer only, meaning, the connection runs off whoever the host is, which means if the host leaves, THE ENTIRE LOBBY CLOSES DOWN and kicks everyone out. Which ruins the fun.\n3) The hackers in general. There are hack lobbies and straight up hackers. Cheating in Jason X or Salvini (Jason X not being out and Salvini you cant get anymore without hacking), teleporting across the map, maxed out stats even higher then Tommy Jarvis's, and making weapons huge. The Jason hackers instantly teleport to you and kill you, or even more things that I don't want to get into or this paragraph will get to long. The hackers kill the games fun\n(Again wrote this at 12 am so I might re-write lmfao)\n\n\nOverall, I would not buy this game unless you are okay with playing offline bots or private matches with at least 5 friends. This game has been left to rot, and there is nothing we can do about it sadly.",

The only thing bad about them is that rain can be annoying, but it obviously isn't every match. \n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Starring at walls is better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\nNot for everyone, but if you like being chased by killers and doing anything you can to defend yourself, you'd like this game. Very similar to games like Dead By Daylight, Identity V, Horror Show, etc. \n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\nPretty average audio. There's special sound cues for a lot of things if you pay enough attention. The kill audio is somewhat lackluster. \n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Human\n\u2610 Lizards\n\nBrutal kills, blood and guts. It's a Friday The 13th game, it's gonna be adult. \n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\nI have a work/office computer upgraded with a 1050 ti, and I can run 60 fps at lowest settings, so you really don't need too much.\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nYou can play the game a bit and ask around for advice, and you'll probably understand the game well in 40 hours or so. Mastering it from there would take around 300 hours.\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610  Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611  Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\nPermanent double xp and cp(customization points used for perks and kills) means you can idle in a closet, and if you survive, you'll still have enough points to get a kill or a \nperk. Additionally, there are a decent amount of modded lobbies that drop a ton of xp and cp when they finally end. \n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 Story?\n\u2610 Text or Audio floating around\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\nJarvis and Pamela tapes give some good story and the virtual cabin counts as well. I wouldn't go into this game for that though. If you want to play this game, it should be for the gameplay. \n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\nThe PVP aspect is built in infinite game time.  \n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2611  Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\nGet it on sale. \n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2611 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\nThis game is infamous for bugs, but in 2021, there really aren't that many. There's one or two exploit spots left in the maps, but as most players right now are new because of the Christmas sale, you hardly ever see them used(at the time of writing, I haven't seen any on PC, but I've seen them used twice on PS4).\n\n---{Community}---\n\u2610 Non-existent \n\u2610 Meh\n \u2611Good\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Call of Duty Black Ops multiplayer lobbies. \n\nA couple people are toxic in game, but outside of that, groups like https://www.reddit.com/r/F13thegame\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/438740/discussions/0/\nhttps://discord.gg/fridaythe13thgame\nand ps4 community groups still are very active with players willing to help out.",

  "review": "This game is worth buying.\nI can say, with a moderate degree of certainty, that I have watched the Friday the 13th films more than any other person on the face of the earth. For the past twenty years, a week hasn\u2019t gone by that I haven\u2019t replayed the entire franchise at least once. The reasons for this are unimportant, but the fact of it is inarguable. I know the look and feel of the Friday films as well as it is possible to. So, it should mean something when I say that the videogame incarnation of Friday the 13th appears to have been made by people who care about the franchise almost as much as I do.\n\nAn asymmetrical multiplayer experience, Friday the 13th puts one player in the role of Jason, the mass-murdering antagonist of the titular film series. On the other side, up to seven players become the camp counselors he\u2019s tasked with brutally dispatching. At the beginning of each match, a video plays in which Jason crashes a party in the most aggressive way imaginable, and then all of the players are scattered around the map, trying to escape while being ruthlessly hunted. They can accomplish this by repairing a vehicle and driving or boating out, by calling the police and reaching a rescue point, or by simply surviving a twenty-minute round with Jason on their heels.\n\n\u2026That last option is, by far, the most difficult.\n\nWhile the counselors are busy looking for car batteries and gas cans, Jason has a wide variety of tools at his disposal. He can pick any random point on the map and teleport within ten meters of it, use a \u2018shift\u2019 power to zoom forward at high-speed like the POV demons from Sam Raimi\u2019s Evil Dead films, mute the music that plays when he\u2019s closing in on counselors so that they don\u2019t know he\u2019s nearby, or turn a Jason-vision power on to let him see where nearby counselors are, even through obstructions. If it sounds like Jason is overpowered, that\u2019s because he\u2019s supposed to be \u2013 he\u2019s an efficient, tireless killing machine.\n\nWhile there are any number of ways to delay or hurt Jason, once he\u2019s fixated on a single counselor, it\u2019s almost certain that they\u2019re going to get killed. Friday the 13th\u2018s greatest achievement is that these deaths rarely feel unfair \u2013 yes, it can be frustrating if Jason uses his first teleport of the game to coincidentally arrive next to the cabin that a player spawned inside, but the developers have cleverly made early-round Jason weak enough for canny players to be able to outdistance him until his shift power unlocks around the two-minute mark. Although escaping is certainly satisfying, there\u2019s plenty of satisfaction to be found in simply dodging and delaying Jason.\n\n",

  "review": "This could be a decent hide and seek game if it was not abandoned by devs.\n\nHere's why I don't recommend this game:\n\n1. Official dedicated servers are closed and players host game sessions. It means if the host quits the game, everyone is kicked from the session. After playing for a few hours, all of the hosts I played with left the game once they got killed. It's hard to enjoy the game like this.\n\n2. There is no way to manage your game session. I had an opportunity to host the game for a few times and I decided not to quit and allow other players to complete the session even if that means I have to spend 15 minutes of watching others playing after I got killed. However, some players who joined my hosted session started abusing the game such as the Killer and Survivor cooperating to kill others and just messing around with the game. Since I could not remove them from my hosted game (kick or ban), I had to ask myself, do I really want to waste my time and host the game for such ***holes who don't want to play fair?\n\nSo the question is, is there any way to enjoy the game? Yes, if you have at least 4 friends who are willing to play this game in a private session. Private sessions are the only way to actually enjoy the game.\n\nHowever, if you don't have many friends who are willing to play the game and you just want to enjoy the game with some other players, I do not recommend it.",

Eventually when I was able to find a lobby and play, it was the most unenjoyable experienced due to how toxic the community is. The people make this game almost unplayable.

Te puedes tardar hasta 10 minutos en encontrar una partida, para que un vato se bugge en una casa y te eche a perder tu entretenimiento.

But i am talking about the time when this game had the dedicated servers. Match making didn't take a long time . but after the dedicated servers were taken down , match making became fairly difficult. U can host ur own lobby or play in other players lobby . But when other players are the host, they can leave the match midway and it will end the game for everyone. Another big issue is, it is pretty difficult to find a full lobby or to find decent amount of people in a lobby for a better experience. Now the bottom line is , don't buy this game unless u are friends with a few players owning it and playing it regularly. If u are friends with a few of those players, u can still enjoy this game. But playing against random is a very painful experience now a days unless u are the host.",

  "review": "There is a good game in Friday the 13th that pops its blood-soaked head up every now and then. Its asymmetrical teenager-versus-supernatural-murderer premise is one that will speak to anyone with an affinity for survival games, cooperative problem solving, and '80s slasher films. It has great potential, which is why you can't help but be frustrated to see it left unrealized, if not outright squandered.\n\nA single match lasts 20 minutes, and that time will either fly by or feel twice as long depending on which role you're randomly assigned to. As a camp counselor, you are set free in one of three maps pulled from early Friday the 13th films, and are tasked with either repairing escape vehicles, calling the cops, hiding from Jason until the end of the match, or killing him--an obtuse and complex process that the game never explains, let alone hints at. If you are the lucky one who's picked at random to play Jason, your only goal is to kill every counselor that you can get your hands on.\n\nPlaying as Jason is without a doubt the most enjoyable time you'll have with Friday the 13th. As the lone killer, you are essentially unstoppable, and you gain new abilities over the course of a match that increase both your awareness and mobility. Jason can warp from one end of a camp to the other, rush across large stretches of land (think Evil Dead's encroaching force), detect fearful or active counselors, and silence the haunting theme that usually plays when he's approaching a target. He will also earn the strength to bust through doors rather than hack them open, a skill that directly thwarts a counselor's best line of defense: shelter. Playing as Jason is the epitome of a power fantasy.",

When the game was recieving updates it had massive potential, it was so fun running around with randoms some of them would RP, others would sweat, overall it was a really good time. However all good things must come to an end, the end for this game was the lawsuit against the rights to own the game. This essentially stopped all content, and cannot update the game. Its super super sad, the devs added a lot of creative and fun things. I would rec if you want a scary party game with some friends or just a big group fun time things.",

This game is not worth any money if you don't plan on playing it much, but if you do then its worth it if its just like 3 euros. \n\n-This game is not updated and there won't be any more content released due to legal issues, so there are quite a few bugs.\n-The killer in this game is too op and can kill everyone way too quick which can make it seem pointless. \n-Not many people play the game so you end up playing with the same people and queues are kinda long.\n-They removed dedicated servers so connection depends on host.\n-The community still seems to be surprised to see a ''gamer girl'' and i get very sexist/sexual comments and creepy guys.\n\n+ great to play with friends\n+ Overall really fun survival game \n+ Great graphics and gameplay\n\nIf this game continued to develop it would turn out to be a really good game.

  "review": "The game is dead, but I still recommend it. The more people the better.\n I got it for free on the PlayStation 4 on October of 2018, I believe. It was fun to play with friends, but I could see that lobby waiting times kept growing.\n I come back to this game, late 2019 to early 2020, I play it and it's really hard to find any lobbies. But at least with enough patience, I could. This game was basically dead.\n I got a new PC, spring of 2020. I buy this game due to it being super cheap at the time. I was disappointed. Yes, I did hear about the lawsuit but I still thought the PC situation is better than the PS4. The game was dead. I'm not sure I even found a lobby with more than 3 people. It's really sad, as this game is pretty good and I definitely would recommend it. I think this game should be for free, not because of greed (as I own the game already), but for all of the other players out there.",

  "review": "It seems like a game about cruelty, violence and murder, but in 4 hours of playing, 6 friends were added to me, so if you have no friends, then this game is for you!\nAs for me, Friday is many times steeper than Dbd, the map is 5-6 times larger, there are much more opportunities to escape (call the police, go to the cars, sail away on the boat, kill Jason).\nI also want to note the quite adult community, for all 4 hours of the game I met 3-4 guys who were <14 and then, these guys were quite positive and funny :)\nI also liked that survivors can kill survivors, I saw such a picture, when they repaired the car, there are 4 guys waiting for it to start, then the 5th player runs out of the bushes and kills the 1st player with a gun and gets into the car instead , yes, it's mean, but in a regular game it's every man for himself!\nAnd yes, everyone can voice chat, even Jason, but only if you are in close proximity to each other, or you have a walkie-talkie!\nThere are private lobbies in the game, in which you can play with friends and decide who will be Jason (in ordinary games, his role is given randomly, unless of course you have priority in your search for the survivors). I want to note that playing in a private lobby gives even more experience points than in a regular game, this is another reason to play with friends.\nI would like to say a few words about the atmosphere. Everything is gloomy around, you can only hear owls and crickets, if Jason approaches you, then creepy music begins.\nThe game has a combat system: block, hit, dodge. Blocking really helps, but in cases where Jason is playing against you, who only waves an ax ...\nThere is pumping in the game, for a battle you will receive experience, it is needed to raise the level and to open perks for survivors and various finishing moves from Jason, there are really a lot of them, but on the map itself you can contact various objects, for example: you can grab survivor and kill him on the spot in 4 different ways, or throw it into the fireplace or smash his head on the door. In Dbd, the only way to kill a survivor other than Mori's mimento is by hanging from a hook.\nI liked the graphon, although the game is not very optimized, when the Witcher 3 is stable at 60 fps on ultras, and Friday at 25-40, this is not normal, BUT at 30 fps it is also comfortable to play it.\nThere is a \"fear of characters\" in the game, if you see a dead ally, then you will not catch a big scrimp and your screen will turn gray, if you see Jason, then your entire screen will be black.\nJason can kill in different ways, set a trap, if the survivor gets caught, he will be slowed down. Throwing throwing knives, but there is not much sense in them, are needed in order to finish off a completely wounded survivor. Just beat with a weapon, usually 3 hits are enough and the most effective is to grab the survivor and execute him, but in this case, the survivor will have the opportunity to stab you with a knife, so you need to execute quickly.\nFriday the 13th has a bunch of different characters, 1 of them have more stamina and stamina, which allows you to run faster and longer. The 2nd has more hp, the 3rd has intelligence, which makes it faster to repair.\nJason was also not spared, he also has several options from different parts of the film, the 1st has a pickaxe and the ability to carry traps, the 2nd has a spear and he can take more knives with him.\n\nAll fans of the film and fans of this genre definitely take it!\nI am 100% sure that you have not read this comment to the end :)",

Most people that play are nice and make it fun with the proximity chat. I always find myself laughing a ton while playing. They just updated it so players are the hosts of the game now compared to the actual server itself. This means if the host quits the game comes to an end and that is the biggest complaint as of right now. Also I feel like $20 is expensive for a game this is costing them next to nothing to keep on the shelf.",

This is what I have to say.\n\nFirst of all, let's make it clear: with only around 400 players at a time, this game is pretty dead. And that's probably the biggest hurdle when it comes to drawing other players to it.\n\nHowever, regarding the content itself, I believe It's quite an amusing game which you'll be able to play over and over. The mechanics and tasks are as follows: \n\n+As a counselor, you will cooperate with other players, hide from Jason, collect weapons for self-defence, and above all, escape Camp Crystal Lake, either by finding a way to flee, or by managing to survive for 20 minutes without getting slain.\n\n+ As Jason, your duty will be slaughtering all counselors by any means before they escape or the time runs out. To that purpose, you'll count on 4 special abilities, in addition to throwing knives and bear traps.\n\nYou might've heard no updates have been added since a lawsuit has been involved (and that's what killed this game), but its current content is more than enough to have a blast.\n\nIf you have a bunch of friends to play with, or you don't mind playing as Jason against NPCs or waiting to play with random people, then don't even hesitate to purchase it. On sale or not, you won't regret it. This game is a solid YES.",

  "review": "[h1]F13 is a Must-Play Game in a Less-than-Ideal Package[/h1]\n\nFriday the 13th: The Game is truly something special in the gaming sphere. Flawed in many ways, marred for years by bad development and upkeep, stuck in the middle of an IP lawsuit, plagued by hackers and DDOS attacks. But still F13 remains three years in, the player base still the same as two years ago. Why did this game not just vanish into obscurity? I believe it's because it's the only asymmetrical horror game that's gotten close to the mark.\n\nThough inundated with many ever changing bugs over the years, F13 has more or less remained a consistent experience. 7 people try to out-fight and out-wit Jason and escape the area without dying. By working together, the 7 counselors have a good shot at getting away - escaping without teamwork is a much tougher, though not impossible task. Here's where both the glory of F13 and what people consider it's worst fault come hand and hand: The toxic community.\n\nYou'll find plenty of reviews that state one the worst things in this game is the toxic community. However, I say that this is a crucial part of the magic that is F13. There is nothing more cinematic than 7 complete strangers getting dropped into a summer camp and having to survive against an extra-powerful serial killer. The best games are rooms with a few funny people, a couple jerks, a girl needing all the attention, and a Russian guy that doesn't speak English. Double points if you get a Jason that plays up the serial killer character.\n\nThe ensuing madness of the random people being gathered together, arguing and fighting, making petty alliances, betraying others, this is what makes it something else. There's nothing scary about a horror game where your team has everything fully under control - you're just doing Objective A, then B, then you win. The magic of F13 is the insane roll of the dice that is every match, the grab bag of people you get, the odds of the map items being in good spots, the poor sap that's playing Jason, the pure chaos of it all.\n\nNow while I admit this game has the \"magic\" that other asymmetrical horror games are missing, don't overlook the cons that can break the game for you. To start, as the bulk of this review states, the community is nuts. You may have to play several games to get a great experience sometimes, which can be annoying when you're loading up the game to relax. I argue the thrill and entertainment from a good match shockingly balance out the frustration of lesser matches.\n\nAnother major con is the developers themselves. You don't have to [url=https://gamecrate.com/dead-again-rise-and-fall-friday-13th-game/20774]research deeply[/url] to find how dodgy and incompetent they have been with this game. Bugs have always plagued the game, and they often play into the programming trope \"fix one bug, create 2 new ones\". But, despite the large and various bugs over the years, they have eventually fixed nearly all of them. The con for you a player is waiting for the fix, which has left this game unplayable at times.\n\nYou'll hear people say the game has been abandoned, but if you check the [url=https://twitter.com/friday13thgame]F13TG Twitter[/url], it's never stopped being active with updates, bug fixes, new console releases, and more. The IP lawsuit over the F13 franchise has stopped content development, but they have kept the game alive despite people saying the opposite.\n\n[b]FINAL VERDICT[/b]\nF13 is a must-play game in a less than ideal package, capturing raw moments that Dead by Daylight and others are not capable of. Due to the chaotic nature of the game and it's community, players could find it disappointing at the $20 price tag at first. With persistence however, you're sure to find plenty of match experiences that make the game worth your while in the long run. At the sale price of $5-10, this game is a steal and a must have in your library.",

The game holds up pretty well after all this time and is still incredibly fun to play both with friends and randoms. But as all multiplayer team-based games it suffers greatly from griefers and cheaters. I also rarely see english speaking people and if i see them they usually grief. But still most of the community is friendly and fun and its an amazing game to play!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGO PLAY IT NOW",

  "review": "Friday the 13th: The Game is so full of bugs, broken mechanics, and server issues that it is nearly unplayable. Half the time you launch this game, you are unable to even join a lobby no matter if you're joining a public lobby or wanting to play with your friends. Now don't get me wrong, the gameplay itself is pretty enjoyable if you're playing with a ton of your friends, but half the time you can't even experience the gameplay considering your friends won't be able to join your lobby. In my opinion, even if you can get into a lobby, it's really only fun if you're playing with a ton of your friends, and considering this game is $20 (unless it's on sale) the chances you convince enough of your friends to buy the game to even have a full lobby is possible, but unlikely.\n\nWhile Friday the 13th: The Game is a pretty fun game to play if you play with all your friends, due to the fact that it's riddled with bugs, broken mechanics, and server issues, I don't recommend this game at the current prices tag of $20.",

  "review": "Grade: [strike] 6,5/10 [/strike] 5/10\nI recommend this game to all those people who like simple survival horror games, but suggest you to get it when it's on sale or gratis (for example in Halloween's promotions). After a legal dispute, the game developers do not update Friday the 13th anymore, so don't expect any other DLC. Developers' measures against cheaters and hackers are usually insufficient (or  useless): this aspect will make the game sterile and repetitive in the long-run, if you don't coop with other players. \nSo, if you want to get this game, buy it at the right time.\n\nEdit: Some players (me included) have been blocked from hackers, so they cannot play anymore and developers probably will not intervene. After last patch of f13 (which is evidently the last one of its life), there aren't offical public servers anymore, so lobbies will behave like private sessions: if the host quits, the match is done. Due to an increasingly toxic and rogue community, it will probably become difficult to conclude a match as it should. \nCompletely unsuitable quality/price ratio.",
