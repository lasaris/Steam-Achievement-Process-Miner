  "review": "This pretends to be a game about making a colony survive, but the colony will survive if you do nothing but build a food station.\n\nThis is really a game about micromanagment and fighting with the UI.\n\nFor example, digging a room. The most basic thing in the game. The dig tool drags a rectangle, but colonists don't dig with any kind of logic, so if you drag a room bigger than 4x4, they'll build it in some ridiculous order that leaves most of it unreachable, even though every point is reachable during the digging if you dig sanely.\n\nWhy does the dig tool even allow you to do more than 4x4? I dunno. If you do it you're fucked.\n\nYou can build \"tiles\" for walls and floors. But you're in a cave so, uh, why. You might later discover you can put some wires and pipes but not all wires and pipes through tiles. But the game doesn't say that, it says you can put them through walls and floors. So if you trust that, and try to build a pipe through a pre-existing floor, your water tank floods.\n\nYou can usually build stuff on top of diggable tiles and it'll dig + build for you, but 15% of the time that doesn't work and you get stuck with \"unreachable dig/unreachable build\". So you're never gonna use that feature, the times it fucks you are way worse than the mild convenience of it working.\n\nIn the end you build stuff a couple tiles at time while micromanaging priority, otherwise everything falls apart. If that's the playstyle the game's built for, why have the abstraction of orders and jobs and errands anyway? Just let me manually control a colonist -- it's what I'm forced to do anyway, through layers of UI indirection.\n\nOther major issues:\n\nThe tech tree is a nonsensical joke. You have wires and combustion within a few minutes -- you should be able to build a water purifier with either of those alone, but you can't. 20 cycles in and you'll have a water filter based on sand. It doesn't work on germs, which is insane because a similar filter system is enough to remove _radiation_.\n\nWhat is the difference between \"polluted water\" and \"water with germs in it\"? I dunno. I also don't know why polluted water adds germs to regular water but they don't mix.\n\nActually no fluids or gases mix. They act as if they're always settled out of solution. 90% of all water/air problems in this game could be solved with a $5 desk fan, which makes playing the game pretty unfulfilling.\n\nPipes automatically connect into junctions and have a separate building type for \"pipe bridge.\" This is the complete opposite way it works in real life and is nonsensical. It also leads to easy-to-make, hard-to-spot mistakes with fluid mixing, which again requires actual effort to achieve in the physical system they're simulating and should never, ever happen without explicit building of a pipe junction.\n\nGas pressure is nonsensical. Twelve algae plants in a row produce enough oxygen to rupture eardrums, yet that pressure cannot escape through the shaft in the ceiling my people climb down to get into my oxygen chamber. What? There's no airlocks or anything, my whole base is open-plan. A several meter opening cannot be a choke point for a gas that at it's worst is pressurized to 60 psi.\n\nDoes water obey the same pressurization rules? Of course not. The couple feet of water in my tank above it provides much less pressure but still flows immediately into this high-pressure oxygen tank.\n\nHonestly, they should remake the game with all the characters as aliens and all the materials as fictional. Using the same people and stuff (more or less) that we use on Earth but obeying absolutely none of the rules makes the whole game feel like a frustrating joke.\n\n\n",

Just the careful management of a limited supply of resources. However, like all the other space colony simulation games out there, the game just continuously ramps up in complexity over time. New tech unlocks new solutions but also new problems that require increasingly more elaborate contraptions to deal with. For some people, that's the whole point of the game, and unlocking tech that would completely solve early game problems would make it too easy. For me it just means that the game becomes an ever increasing headache of tangled pipes and wires until I look at my base and feel exhausted at the thought of playing anymore.",

  "review": "Great concept with great realization, very complex, which brings me to my main argument against this game - the original complexity has been broken and unbalanced by some dubious decisions made during development. Sadly I can't recommend it. Klei's games are very polar - they are either painfully hard and force you to give up on them (like Don't Starve), or too easy, like this one. I actually quite liked the game during Beta, it really felt dangerous and urgent to secure your survival. But somewhere along the line Klei seemingly made a decision to cater to 'casual players' crowd and 1) reworked the disease system, removing the 'immunity stat' and 2) reworked the morale system. Back in Beta diseases were terrifying. I remember polluting my water supply and my Duplicants are suddently falling ill and infecting each other, boy, it was fun. Now diseases got so nerfed that it makes medicine buildings laughably unimportant (immunity boosters, what?). Germs die on their own, duplicants can walk back from Slimelung biome and stay perfectly healthy... what a joke. Also it seems morale requirements were loosened so much that I don't really need to invest in any decor. Back in Beta it was so fun to struggle for each morale point so your Duplicant could get the much desired upgrade - now my Duplicants master three branches of specialties with ease. Oh yes, they removed the Jobs system, so you can be Jack of All trades now, which kills immersion for me. I can't recommend it because this game, as a whole, isn't a cohesive (coherent?) picture - some systems make sense, and some don't. Building and managing your base works. But planning your base (Decor) isn't. It's pointless, because you don't need so many Morale. Medicine, doctors and disease are there, but they are pointless. Critters are there, but you don't need them (higher quality food only needed for more morale, which, as I said before, isn't needed anymore). I think the original creators were overruled at some point and now we have it.",

  "review": "While the game has a charming art style and atmosphere, everything about it feels like the developers were trying to imitate mechanics of games like Factorio or Space Station 13 without actually understanding what makes those click.\n\nThe game is [i]filled[/i] with core design issues that I can only chalk up to the developers not quite realizing what the problems with their own game are.\n\nI will just list off a rant of some of the various issues I have ran into. Some of these issues aren't a problem anymore but I still feel like they highlight my core point:\n\n* Polluted oxygen [b]used[/b] to have the exact same weight value as regular oxygen. Now normally the primary way to handle gas circulation in your base is gravity. Let CO2 sink to the bottom of the base outside the primary areas, etc... But because polluted O2 has the same weight, it would not rise and fall [i]at all[/i]. It was incredibly easy to get random pockets of polluted oxygen in the middle of your base carrying germs. How do you get rid of these? The only way to is to build air purifiers in the middle of rooms, on top of a construction of ladders and walls, and then take them out when the polluted O2 was cleaned up. This was just an insanely stupid thing to have to deal with manually. It [b]did eventually get fixed[/b] so that polluted O2 has a different weight, but if I recall correctly this was a problem even in the 1.0 release of the game. How did it take this long for a dev to play their own game and realize \"wow, this is stupid\"?\n\n* You can only have a single type of gas on a single tile, completely breaking realistic gas pressure handling. This has various fun consequences like duplicants farting being able to wreak havoc on your farm because it creates pressure voids that cause the plants to stop growing. The devs clearly didn't even think to bandaid this by making plants only stop growing after like 5 seconds of pressure void.\n\n* Actual parts necessary for basic automation just aren't god damn there. You can have duplicants carry bottled liquids and gases as a replacement for laying pipes manually. You would think this would be VERY useful for long range transit to avoid laying pipes, but no it still sucks. There is no way to actually load gases from pipes to bottles directly (or vice versa). So to make duplicants manually transport bottled thigns from a pipe (not an unreasonable requirement) you have to get into extremely complicated, power hungry, and space-inefficient setups involving airlocks, cisterns, pumps, and filters. Just lay the pipe manually. This problem permeates EVERY attempt at automating anything. It feels like the game just isn't designed to have automation done in it, despite all the tools it clearly tries to give you for it.\n\n* Various automation setups just make no sense. How do you effectively remove germs from water? Use the extremely power-hungry water heater, because germs die at a certain temperature? Nah just put a sealed water tank in a chlorine atmosphere. This kills germs. ???????? And then deal with all the ass-pains in automating this because you can't put germ sensors on [i]tanks[/i], only pipes, so now you can't easily detect automatically when the tank is clear of germs without, again, insane contraptions that shouldn't be necessary.\n\n* Pipe handling is still buggy and stupid. If you put a chain of machines on a single straight pipe the machines will constantly choke eachother because they see [b][i]any[/i][/b] liquid on their output pipe and just go \"pipe clogged, ded\". Even though they have internal buffers, even though the pipe is only 25% filled, etc... You can work around this easily by putting the output pipe one tile higher and making T-junctions, but this [i]shouldn't be necessary[/i]. \n\n* Duplicants are dumb as bricks and the amount of times they (almost) accidentally kill themselves sucks.\n\nA minor tidbit:\n\n* Performance on the Linux version is completely unplayable. Windows is fine but still not great.",

You always have several things that need doing, ranging from emergencies to long-term expansion goals, but if you know what you're doing, you can have everything done well enough (emphasis on \"well enough\"), fast enough that true catastrophe is rare and contained.\n\nOf course, when you're first starting out, expect things to go horribly, horribly wrong.  A lot.  Expect to think everything's alright, only for your power grid to collapse because your hamster wheels are surrounded by CO2.

Problems from providing food, to keeping your machinations from accidentally cooking or choking your dupes to death.\n\nThe end-game of ONI is pretty much re-optimizing your own prototypes or integrating multiple functions into one giant solution.  The game gives you some standard solutions to problems, but none of them will provide you with ultimate stability for your colony, for that you'll need to develop your own solutions that work within and also bend the physics in the game.\n\nIf this sounds interesting or your kinda jam, I whole-heartedly recommend ONI!\n\nGL and HF!",

  "review": "Ok, that's a tough one.\n\nFirst of all, don't believe all this blurb about this being a physically-correct simulation. They tried to simplify it in some places, but physics doesn't like simplifications. The \"simulation\" they ended up with is totally made-up. It tries to pretend to be the real thing, which only creates problems, because the best solutions for many situations in the game is not based on physics, it's based on the abusing of the mechanics.\n\nThis brings me to the second of all: to make any kind of substantial progress you'll have to learn how to exploit the simulation. Normally such things would be called \"features\", and be explained in tutorials and in-game encyclopedias. But since this game pretends to be \"real\", nobody will tell you about this physics-defying behavior. You'll have to find them yourself, or read about them on the forums or on reddit.\n\nThus the game's setting and description plays against its own mechanics. Still, if you do learn about the simulation features (or exploits, depending on your point of view), making them to work for you can be engaging. So while the game is definitely not what it pretends to be, it still is fun.",

My rule of thumb is, do something for about 15 cycles, to ensure it isn't going to be a problem later.

The technology and resources to go even farther out takes a bit of planning and by that point the repetition started to get to me.\n\nThis game reminds me of Don't Starve (by the same company) and Rimworld and to be honest I rather play either of those over this one. Both of those games have more of the world available right off the bat to explore. Rimworld also had more relationships, trading and opposing factions to keep my attention. Maybe I just need to lower the difficulty as I feel this game has a lot of potential.\n\n7.5/10.0",

Relaxing resource/sim management game which has just enough edge to keep you awake. Between the graphics to the UI and easy controls. You can literally lay back and use a mouse for 99% of your dupes actions. With the upcoming DLC major update coming this purchase is worth every bit of your attention. The learning curve is pretty simple but also challenging in complex builds, but you have tons of hours worth of videos and walk-throughs on Youtube from amazing content creators to learn those tricky advance builds. I've lost uncountable hours of sleep playing this before laying down for work the next day and was more excited to come home to work on a build I watched before I fell asleep the night before then tired from the lack of sleep. \n[hr][/hr]\nFinal thoughts, 10/10",

Unfortunately, the game is complete garbage at explaining pretty much anything.\n\nI've restarted 3 times now and at this point I'm debating uninstalling the game and never playing it again. The wiki is too in depth and explains mechanics that are far more complex than you need to know about for quite some time. This is how I've felt the entire time I've been playing ONI.\n\nIt's just... too steep of a learning curve to really get into. Then the moment you think you have even a basic understanding of the game it seems to bend over backwards to throw even worse things to deal with at you. Wire shortages, Morale, Heat dissipation, water, power - none of these things are done in a simple \"place it and forget about it way.\"\n\nThe absolute worst sin this game commits however is planning ahead. You constantly need to be thinking about issues BEFORE they become issues. If you've played this game a lot, then this is a good thing as more depth/complexity is great if you already have a moderate understanding of game mechanics.\n\nBut if you're new like me - and you have no idea what the next major project you should be working on is - then it feels like one slap in the face after another.\n\nI feel like I payed money just for this game to troll me.\n\nSo the game comes down to this for me: If you have the patience, the time, and the sheer fucking will to keep playing this game and force yourself to learn all the game mechanics despite every setback or complete restart, then this game is great.\n\nFor anyone else: Don't buy it - straight up plain and simple - go play something else.",

It starts off with a good rush to get food and oxygen, then you'll be contriving some weird contraptions to delete heat and maybe create infinite electrical energy, and then a truly tedious rocket part.\n\nAfter one successful run I started a second but could not find enough enthusiasm to persist beyond the mid-game.

  "review": "The game is fun, but does not run smoothly. My system has 64gb ram, 11gb GPU and running a new intel extreme processor, and the game still has issues the later into the game I get. Around cycle 350 to 500, the game becomes frustrating with taking up to a couple of minutes for the auto save function to perform its task, before the game will continue. It might appear that your game has crashed, but this is just how the game performs. This does not seem to be as reliant as system design as just the bottleneck in game design. \n\nThe speed up process also become a bad choice with any more than 16 duplicates, as the game takes the same amount of time to go through its checklist to see who performs what task, regardless of speed selected to play. This means that playing accelerated gameplay will result in an increase duplicate idle time ratio comparatively. When racing the clock on anything, always run in the slowest/normal speed, else you can end up wasting time and failing to accomplish tasks by their deadlines. \n\nBe careful altering the priority settings, as this can essentially stun lock duplicates, making them do jitters instead of accomplishing anything. For some reason, if two tasks are equal in importance for a duplicate, they will sometimes (and often in later cycles) cycle between the two tasks, doing nothing but a two step shuffle between the first step towards each task, but no further. I found this especially problematic with tidy tasks between gathering ice and anything else. I had to set the resource box for the ice to a lower rating, so it would end up getting those last, which solved most of the two step shuffle issues. \n\nThe game performs excellent for the first 200 or so cycles, and is very fun, but after that, it because a race to patience versus success. I find that I reset the game often, starting over, just because I am tired of the auto save feature making the game play tedious. I consider this a major game issue, and would rate the game far more favorably if they can fix this. As is, this is a fun game that I recommend, but expect your patience to be tested if you venture through many cycles, instead of rush to the finish line.",

  "review": "You're dropped in the middle of an asteroid, and the goal is to simply survive. You start with three clones. They need water, food, and oxygen. Simple, right?\n\nYour starting zone has plenty of water to get by, there's plenty of cheap food to farm, and loads of algae to create oxygen, what could go wrong?\n\nBut soon, your starting biome algae supply runs out. Your dupes need oxygen or they won't be able to survive for even one cycle, after all. So then you use water on an electrolyzer to turn them into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can then be used for powering your base, how efficient!\n\nBut uh oh, the water is starting to run out. So you quickly find a water geyser and pump that water into your base. Crisis averted, right? Except the water is coming out at 70\u00b0C, and now your base is heating up, and your crops are dying because of the heat. You now have 3 cycles to solve the food problem. Lucky for you, there's a food item that compresses dirt with water to form a \"mush bar\".\n\nBut as your technology improves and clones level up, they demand longer breaks, more amenities, and better quality food. Having low quality mush bars for temporary food when they've been accustomed to pepper bread and berry wraps makes them throw up from all the stress. Now you have to deal with a contaminated water supply full of puke. But first things first, need to cool that water down so you can farm again.\n\nWater has a high specific heat capacity though, so it'll take a ton of energy to remove all that heat. Better to just move the base elsewhere. Then you look up a guide on how to create a system that deletes heat, and after much scrambling around you manage to create enough steel to start deleting heat. Finally, you're starting to make some headway.\n\nExcept now, your base needs more water, so you try to dig through the slime biome. Only you had no experience dealing with slimelung, and now you watch in horror as your entire base collapses from COVID.\n\nAnd all of before you even touched rocketry.\n\n5/5",

  "review": "Oxygen not included is an exceptionally difficult game to grasp. It involves managing a stranded group of individuals on a space-like game style. It is heavy on managing resources and managing people\u2019s mental health, health in general and specific needs to the individual. \n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\nSmooth gameplay\n         1. Hundreds of hours of gameplay without getting bored.\n         2. Different challenges that make you use your brain. (Or google) \n         3, Different ways of playing. (Demonic, Peaceful) \n         4, Challenges around every corner. \n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY [/h1]\n\nGameplay is starting out with 3 starter characters that you choose to play the game. You also start in a rock that you will have to make into your base. Or the base of the characters. You have 4 things to worry about when starting the game. \n    1. Restroom\n    2. Water\n    3. Oxygen/power\n    4. Food\nYou must get these four basic things down before you can worry about progressing the game. If you don\u2019t have these basic things down your game will end up in the trash bin. I personally had to play the game multiple times before I got the hang of it. Over time you will be able to get \u201cPrintables\u201d which is when you have 4 choices on what to get. This happens every 3 cycles. Or 3 ingame days. Usually there are 3 characters and 1 misc item. You can\u2019t go willy nilly on getting characters though. You need to make sure that the food supply can handle another mouth. Have another bed, another restroom and need for the extra hand so they are not idle. Later down the line you must worry about germs. Germs are a serious threat against your colony because if not taken cared for soon it can make your entire crew through up profusely and have an even bigger problem on your hands. I shall leave the rest of the game for you to find out.\n\n\n[h1]CONS [/h1]\nSome of the gameplay can have some downsides and this is where I will put all of my recommendations to make the game better\n\nThe AI can get finicky when building, digging so on. \nThe priority system is not specific enough when multitasking. You are left to find out why they are not going after a 9 priority. Or why they are not going after a yellow mark. This should be explained better for the player\nWhen picking up polluted dirt. It should not be able to go into a storage bin. This creates a problem for the player. When sweeping the polluted dirt it should go straight to the composition bin. Not the storage bin. \n\n\n[h1]OVERALL [/h1] \nOverall this game is a must when your mind works like a mechanic, or anyone that solves problems. The gameplay is outstanding with just a couple of kinks. When getting the game download the extra content. It is a different way of playing the game that I have yet to delve into. Happy playing!",

If you like feeling smart while consistently failing anyways, play this. \n\nLiterally the best resource management game I've ever played. Would recommend to anyone who needs to kill time with an engaging game or who loves automation and task management. \n\nAs a programmer, the number of systems to play with really tickles the problem solving part of my brain, so I'd recommend it to programmers universally. When I play this game, I feel like I'm solving problems, not just running into them. Every second I play, I feel like I'm creeping towards perfect efficiency (I'm not, I kinda suck at it). \n\nThis game is amazing. 10/10",

The dupes are cute and fun, the game gives you so much creative freedom to tackle problems, and offers a variety of changes for all players.  Dont want to stress about issues and life threatening problems?  This game offers a stress free mode to explore that.  The sandbox mode is great for tinkering with ideas to implement on your game.  You will spend hours trying to test out your latest crazy idea.  This game is easily one of my favorite games of all time.  If you like management games and survival games, this is the best of the best!\n\n10/10!",

Yes. It's just frustrating but when you knew that it is actually hxll a lot of simpler, you just facepalm yourself.

It took me a while to figure out that I was digging into an ice biome and the duplicants were storing ice in warmer areas, where it would eventually melt and leak into the environment. My solution was to have a special storage container above my water reservoir the only stores ice. Figuring out these solutions is fun, but finding the cause of a problem can be frustrating. These quality of life issues have slowly gotten better with updates, and there are some mods that help, but keep in mind that Klei Entertainment seems to have a \"quantity over quality\" mindset when it comes to gameplay mechanics.",

Honestly just buy the game, watch a tutorial online and try it out. It's so incredibly cool. All I ever could want from a factory game in one and more sprinkled on top. You need to manage your power grid, have a solid supply of oxygen, have enough space for new rooms, honestly the game is so good, it 100% can advocate for itself. One small point of critique would be that watching beginner guides on youtube is pretty much a must, there are MANY things that are very important to understand, and with no tutorial to get you started you're going to make many mistakes at first.

Almost a \"rogue-lite\" in that part of the fun is the ridiculous ways your entire colony can die, so you start again with new dupes with random traits on a random rock.   \n\"Using recycled toilet water contaminated the farm and the crops weren't safe.  We found food in the wild, but it was contaminated, too.  We contracted slimelung and died.\"\n\"Got everything we need to survive and stopped going out.  However, all the machinery generated heat, which we couldn't deal with, so it kept building, and we died.\"\n\"Picked the wrong dupes, ran out of algae because of filthy mouth-breathers, so we all suffocated and died.\"\n\nAlmost like the Sims except you have to build and manage various survival systems (food, water, air, heat, comfort, etc).  The key for me is to focus on smaller, short-term goals that eventually lead to a bigger goal.  If you're looking for something to set up then sit back and observe, you may have found it.",

  "review": "I love this game. I can't stop playing it. I don't know what neuron group it's tickling, but it's doing so [i]exquisitely.[/i] It's strongly reminiscent of SimCity to me. Build stuff, break it, make it work. It's quite a rollercoaster ride when you find one of your blind spots is suddenly killing everything. \n\nIf designing and setting things up is your bag this is probably your game. It's shockingly deep and it definitely bears thinking about your moves, especially as the colony grows. Also the art is adorable and the soundtrack will burrow into your head in the best way.\n\nThe only downsides I can mention are appreciable but not show stoppers. The first is that the in-game text is not particularly well written. There are a lot of errors by omission. One small example: to make a barracks you need at least one bed, but the text in-game implies that you can only have one bed. Don't be shy about poking through forums or wikis if you're not sure about something because they are both frustration savers that won't spoil anything (for the most part). \n\n(EDIT: I have found that disabling Samsung RAPID eliminated the vast bulk of CTDs. If you're using RAPID or some other RAM caching program try turning it off if you're having a lot of CTDs) The other is that the game is somewhat prone to lockups and CTDs. Autosave keeps losses to a minimum but don't be shy about saving manually. It's not frequent enough to stop me playing and Klei seem to be on top of patching, but it's worth a mention.\n\nOverall it's a fantastic little game to evaporate hours or whole weekends. Can't recommend it enough.",

Maybe you'll like to fail just to start from scratch and try again or try to patch your current setup with quick fixes that will just turn your base into a silent coffin.

Faced with the challenge of dealing with a gold volcano or dwindling water supplies, I just decided to back away shaking my head instead. \n\nNow, the community has done insane things with automation and clever builds in ONI.

The game doesn't hold your hand, it does have some tutorial items which can be helpful, but who pays attention to those?  Now this isn't a bad thing, the game shouldn't hold your hand, that is apart of the game.  I just get stuck, I get frustrated, and then after playing hours and hours at one time... I put the game down and don't come back to it.\n\nThis is all a personal thing to be honest and something I need to work on.

Barely scratched the surface--tbh, I've never even breached the midgame, really.  It's a deceptively brutal, stressful little toy.  Many reviewers have admitted feeling daunted by the early game because there's so much going on.  Brothers and sisters, if you think the early game is daunting, I'm here to tell you it only gets more so the more you learn about it.  \n\nBut it's just so well-made and fun to fiddle with for a couple of hours at a time.  Then, you will hit a wall.  You either won't know what to do to move forward, or you will realize something about the systems you've designed is so flawed that the colony is doomed.  There are guides aplenty on the web to look up for help, if you want to devote that kind of effort to mastering ONI.  There are so many things to manage.  Power grids, waste disposal, and especially temperature regulation.  You can farm crops and tend livestock you domesticate on your own.  I don't know if I've ever run across a title that I could honestly say is this deep and broad, while appearing so deceptively simple.\n\nWith regards to the particular pros and cons of the title, it just is what it is.  It's difficult, unforgiving, and complex.  It's potentially time-consuming.  Everything I just said amounts to both a con and a pro.  Oxygen Not Included doesn't really apologize for itself, and what can I say?  That's a big part of its charm.  If you're the type of gamer who likes to solve problems, build systems, pursue your own goals; or if you've ever moaned about how much games today try to hold your hand; this one is aimed at you.\n\n10/10 Don't Asphyxiate",

Surprisingly, this is the most scientifically accurate simulation I've ever played. Building a functioning and self-sufficient base is hard (especially if you don't have a wiki next to you handy), but very satisfying. In a relatively-closed system, the solutions you have for one problem seem to always have some other by-product or in turn causes some other problem. This makes you then come up a solution for that, which in turn then has its own byproduct or issue. So you keep trying to apply new solutions or use increasingly advanced tech to solve your problems. This creates a never-ceasing challenge to develop balanced and automated solutions to common problems so that you can set your sights on bigger overall goals. Absolutely addictive and absolutely hits that \"just one more turn\" level of obsession.",

Oxygen Not Included (aka ONI) has a lot of its own features that are very cool.  Watching and managing air flow, heat flow and fluid flow is really satisfying once you get the hang of it.  \n\nYou wouldn't think that having to install plumbing and functional septic systems to recycle water would be so fun, but I really enjoy it.  Then you start carrying over that knowledge to managing heat and oxygen, functionally making an air conditioner system by piping cold water toward your home and hot water out and exchanging temperatures.  \n\nAnd you start managing your oxygen and air, since every little dude you got is breathing in air and breathing out carbon monoxide.  You start seeing little pools of carbon monoxide at the bottom of your base (It is heavier!) and you see it growing into a problem to deal with..  And generating oxygen itself is a task to deal with, since there's not a lot of plant life underground.\n\nThe only thing it doesn't have is much combat, but mere survival is a challenge on it's own, you don't really need things out trying to kill you!",

  "review": "TL;DR: Best hardcore colony management sim out there.\n\nNo-brainer if the following is interesting for you:\n- You want to make your colony breath oxygen kindly provided by vomit, toilets and kinda shit demon.\n- You like to try using magma/molten metal from volcano to smelt sand into glass but rather purify the unclean in your colony with fire.\n- You want to be a father to colonists who often find themselves caved-in.\n- You want to cook your colony on hardest starts because you haven't yet figured out in couple hundred hours how to make a good cooling for them.\n- You love both steampunk AND rockets. All rockets should be steam rockets. Period.\n- You like to spend hours on pause drawing logic schemes on paper to automate your colony to post-scarcity.\n- Robot cleaner is the best cleaner.\n- Your selection rules are harsh enough to reject every single new colonist and be happy.\n- You like animals. Strange animals. Hydrogen breathing and plastic shedding kind of strange.\n- You worship your crab overlords, but don't come close enough to be eviscerated. Unless you are a miner killing machine.\n- You like to collect egg shells from your feline animal farm for generations to melt steel.\n- You want to see what happens if you forget to build a toilet on the first day.\n- You like to get totally raped by the realistic, but not so much physics.\n\nVerdict: Stress + famine + suffocation (lets be honest, strangling) + hypothermia + sun scorches + being melted alive + being eaten by a shy crab family + being eaten by your furnace pet + getting deleted to have a less pathetic start + crying because of knowing too much / 10.\n\n",

What this game has that elevates it higher than other of its genre is in my opinion that you also have to test what you build and see if it works as intended, it's not just like place that building there and that's it.

  "review": "It coulda been good, but the \"crew management\" is hair pulling frusterating.\n\nI'm not talking about moral, stats, diseases, sickness, sleep schedules or any of that. I'm talking about the incredibly limiting Priority system and in general just how remarkably stupid the AI is at getting things done right or efficiently.\n\nAs an example, I watched a duplicate (that's the little people that run your base) go from one side of the base to the other just to pick up 100kg of ore, when they can hold 400kg, and run all the way back to the other side of the base...AND DO IT AGAIN!\n\nWhen you line up a bunch of task far away they don't \"stock pile\" things they'll need ahead of time, and you can't realistically do any such thing manually either. Infact, a big part of the problem is there is very little you can directly do to control them. So you can't make up for their stupidness by doing it yourself.\n\nBuilding a wall that seals your base? sometimes they'll stand on the wrong side and lock themselves out! meaning in a game that is trying to force macro management on you and pull you away from micro, you have to pause - build one tiny spec of wall...wait till it's done....- then pause again and build the next tiny spec of wall, and wait again. All the while this is going on, they stop to go 1 mile to the other side to pick up the supplies instead of stockpiling what they need in a nearby spot ahead of time.\n\nI can't even find any mods that really fix this, this game was it's own undoing. The only actual \"fix\" for their stupidity is to have so many minions that you can brute force their stupididity by speciallizing all of them. The AI is just terrible and I wish i didn't buy the game, even at half off. I don't even wanna finish it because I hate it.",

Each time you figure out an issue and get it all solved, there's something new cropping up that makes you go 'crap! Gotta fix this somehow!' but it's not a stressful kind of thing. I usually hate it when a game goes from fire to fire and your brain gets no rest between each issue, but I feel like Oxygen not included does the tension perfectly. Not too hard or urgent, but you can't really lay back and relax for long stints of time. \n\nNot to mention the systems are complex, but tastefully so! They aren't so complex you need to be a genius to figure it out, but it does require more than 1 braincell to figure out.\n\nI'm not a review writer kind of person, but I read a lot of reviews so I'm not very good at this, but seriously, this game is worth it!

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n",

And then great pain when the most arbitrary non-sensical mechanic causes your colony to come crashing down on your inflated ego.\n\n\n[h1][u]The Good[/u][/h1]\n\n [*]You WILL NOT get to space on your first try. This game is incredibly challenging.\n [*]Cute as heck\n [*]Money vs time entertained ratio is through the roof\n [*]Doesn't blatantly rip off other games or adhere to typical things in the genre\n [*]Great intro to how logic circuits & binary work IRL via Automation buildings\n [*]The devs do care what with the FREE DLC years after release.\n [*]There is always something new to learn.\n [*]So many variables and things to consider.\n [*]Don't like colony sims? I thought I didn't either.\n [*]Failing repeatedly is fun in its own way.\n [*]Making a section of your colony truly automated and self-sustaining is ecstasy. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]The Bad[/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]You WILL NOT get to space on your first try. This game can be incredibly frustrating.\n[*]Bugs bugs bugs...\n[*]Some of the UI decisions are garbage. [fix this with mods]\n[*]Can feel like a second job sometimes\n[*]Bad CPU? Don't even think about having more than a few dozen buddies doing your bidding because your game WILL chug.\n[*]The duplicants have god awful AI by design since the idea is you're filling in the gaps. \nHowever, some moments will make you say \"can you just fucking not?\"\n[*]Playing efficiently or 'meta' almost feels like abusing bugs & mechanics in ways they were not intended, so you should fix this with mods.\n[*]The endgame right now is a bit lacklustre with no real direction. [spoiler]You shoot your dupes off into space on a rocket to bring back materials with better properties to make better machines to allow you to shoot off more rockets...oh[/spoiler]\n[*]Aside from reaching every planet, there isn't much of a 'win' condition. However, this looks like it's gonna be addressed in the upcoming free DLC\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]The [i]'just why?'[/i][/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]You WILL NOT get to space on your first try. This game is a broken mess at times.\n[*]You won't get far without googling/wiki, ingame info is terrible.\n[*]This game will make you hate it because you love it so much.\n[*]Whatever degree/PHDs you have, the game doesn't care.\n[*]Critical information to succeed is either hidden, not in the game or on a wiki somewhere.\n[*]Having open 20 browser tabs open to get info does not help the abysmal performance lategame. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]The Conclusion[/u][/h1]\n\nThe problems this game suffers from are very typical and understandable for a simulation game with so many moving parts. People tend to criticise it much because they're very passionate and attached to this fantastic game & it's not hard to see why. Heck, I spent the better part of 2 hours writing this.\n\nHowever, it doesn't make it any less frustrating for a game you really love. A plethora of mods is highly recommended for your own sanity. There are many collections of mods on the steam workshop page, including my own. However, at the time of writing this there was a recent patch which broken some mods & it's a nightmare trying to figure out which ones won't crash the game. So I'd advise you to add your own tentatively.\n\nONI is an incredible take on colony sims, held back by it's own ambition and desire to provide a deep experience to it's players. Despite being out for 4+ years, the devs are still working on it free of charge and truly do give a hoot and it shows.\n\nLastly, [spoiler]Mia Mia[/spoiler] is by far the[spoiler]hottest[/spoiler]duplicant by far.

But There is one thing that makes it kinda annoying and that is the mid game hump (it starts somewhere around 70-135). It escalates from everything perfect to that your dupes are stressing because of their morale and then because of that they cant work so then there is no electricity and without electricity you cant make water, oxygen, food. And because if that massage tables don't work so they cant reduce their stress and that's where your colony crashes. And if you survive that you also get so many new things from research that you don't know whats necessary of them. And for some people that will repeat after every colony to the point that they become frustrated. I have realized that Klei survival games have a hump that makes the game bad for some people like in Don't Starves Winter.\nEven if i have talked bad about this game its really good and addicting.

The art style is simple yet amazing, the game itself is unique and it just has that general Klei kick to it! I love it, love it, love it!\n\nMoving on from my I-Love-Klei spasm, Oxygen Not Included (also known as ONI) is a game where you start off in the [i]middle[/i] of your chosen asteroid as opposed to the [i]surface[/i]. You start off with 3 duplicants, each with different interests and traits (my personal favourite are one miner, one builder and one researcher). You start of with 16,000kcal of food, which will last you about 4-5 cycles considering how duplicants generally eat between 1,000kcal to 1,500kcal a day. You must excavate the surrounding area and build things to lead your colony to GREATNESS! But for now, you should probably build a manual generator, a research station to go with the manual generator, crack open a water source (from the top so it won't spill) and get a pitcher pump to gain access to said water. Your duplicants will piss on the floor for the first couple o' cycles. That's fine. Just remember to mop it up.\n\nAfter you researched a bunch of things and got a basic colony settled (bathroom, Mealwood farm, power, Oxygen Diffusers and Jumbo Batteries. [i]NEVER[/i] use normal Batteries under [i]ANY CIRCUMSTANCES[/i]), you might want to focus on some more pressing matters at hand. Like Food Poisoning. Food Poisoning is a food-borne infection that, while not infectious, can be detrimental to the duplicant. Make sure to build some Wash Basins near your Outhouses so that Duplicants will wash their hands after using the bathroom. There is also Morale, which is on how happy the Duplicant is. Low Morale can induce stress and cause unwanted behaviour once duplicants reach 100% Stress levels. To increase morale, give your duplicants more pretty stuff. Fulfill room requirements to increase Morale. Mess Halls are a good early-game Morale generator. Pretty-up some things! Add Flower Pots with Bluff Briars to make the decor better! During the duplicants' Downtime, give them some things, like Water Coolers (not recommended late-game), building Recreational Rooms. Y'know, that sort of stuff.\n\nDuplicant stress responses. The reason why you want to keep your duplicants happy. Ugly Criers just cry, causing the decor in the surrounding area to plummet, which may cause more stress for other duplicants. Vomiters vomit (surprise, surprise), and are basically rendered useless, as, once they start vomiting, they may stop vomiting, move a couple of steps to a new place and continue. Binge Eaters kill your food supply by eating a total of 6,000kcal of foodstuff, so that's not helpful, considering my first statement was literally about the sustenance problem. And finally, the Destructive. Destructive duplicants will damage and possibly destroy structures for a set amount of time, and [i]WON'T SLEEP[/i]. They also can't repair structures when they are above 60% Stress levels. Also, when you lose a duplicant, all the other duplicants will gain the Mourning de-buff for 3 cycles.\n\nThis game is really good. The concept is amazing, the gameplay is extraordinary, even the graphics are at such a high resolution when you really zoom in! Overall, this game is just the best. All-in-all, if you want a gaming experience where you must start from zero and build to greatness, give Oxygen Not Included a chance. It was made by Klei, after all.",

  "review": "Easily one of the best resource management games in recent memory. It excels in both difficulty and complexity where many other games drop off. The more you learn the more this game has to offer. In the beginning you start out with little to no understanding of either your goal or the depth of the crisis in which you have placed yourself. Each problem adds a new set of rules and challenges for you to overcome, as well as tests your ability not only to think long term, but in terms of efficiency as well. While you try to tackle new obstacles, you risk expending valuable resources, and occupying increasingly valuable space. This game gradually ups the ante and lets you experience each challenge as it's own trial, while camouflaging a host of seemingly unremarkable events as even less than they appear. The rich progression system allows for various paths to victory. You aren't tethered to any meta, and likewise you aren't prohibited from using said metas to help you learn and progress. \n\nPros: \n    Very intuitive gameplay for a crisis management game.\n    Allows you to make mistakes and still progress while learning without punishing you for learning.\n    Gives you just enough to get you started without babying you, but makes allowances for both slow and fast learners.\n    Doesn't require you to spend hours learning mechanics before playing.\n    Customizable experience, including mods,  allows for unbelievable amounts of replayability.\n\ncons: \n    First several games can end up being very frustrating.\n    Does require some planning and therefore can become quite tedious.\n    There are some issues when you get significantly far into the game where increasing productivity can cause lagging and crashing, although that seems to be mostly fixed.\n\nAll in all this is easily one of the best resources management games I have played in recent memory. Very easy to learn, and incredibly difficult to master. Documentation and explanations of said difficulty is made very clear, and the devs are very dedicated to keeping the game in good shape. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes resource management, or base building games.",

  "review": "It's a game about systems. The food system, the liquid system, the germ system, the heat system, etc.\nThe fun of the game comes from managing all these disparate systems and picking away at tasks to expend your influence over them. Mining more ore, generating more power, cooling more air, building another bathroom, etc.\nIt tries to tap into that \"I'll just do 1 more thing\" feeling but ultimately fails because there never any payoff, you just do stuff till you're bored.\n\nThe game throws lots of complicated mechanics at you, doesn't explain half of them, and has a built in almanac which is fairly incomplete.  Need Refined Carbon but don't know how to get it?  Don't expect the game's almanac to tell you, nor its research tree, you'll have to just keep researching and building new things to find out. The game will reward you with learning through failure.\nIf you know your physical sciences you can extrapolate a lot of mechanics from real world principles (heat capacity, air pressure), but at the same time it violates that by ignoring basic principles in a bunch of places (polluted water stays separate from clean water, hot gas/liquid doesn't rise ......). You need to look things up with external tools or trial and error many mechanics.\n\nAnd the colonists, \"Dupes\". Dupes are there purely to facilitate interaction with these systems. Dupes are mindless automatons with no real worth. Their traits have no meaningful impact on their existence within your colony. As such, there is no attachment to be had with them as individuals making this less of a colony sim and more of an ant farm. Their deaths are meaningless and they are swiftly replaced with more Dupes.\n\nI love games about building colonies, managing resources and creating systems.  This game scratches various itches from Dungeon Keeper, Factorio and RimWorld all at once, but doesn't hold a candle to any of them.  The lack of payoff is deadly to the enjoyment.  You build and manage systems in order to build and manage more systems until you're bored.  There's no great obstacle to overcome, no enemy to outshine, outlast or outgun. \n\nThe game looks and sounds great, with a highly endearing visual style in spite of the sheer amount of faecal plumbing and the systems are robust, but as a game, this was an aggravating and disappointment experience to endure.",
